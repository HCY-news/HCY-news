One of the most influential artists in China, Hua Chenyu draws you into his world of music.

In his arsenal are avant-garde compositions, striking and entrancing performances, and all-encompassing philosophical attitudes towards all things. Music lovers from around the world clamor to fill the seats by the tens of thousands at his signature Mars Concerts as he cuts a blazingpath through the dense fog of the tortuous music market.

In this world of music, everything tilts into the unusual. Quasimodo, in his loneliness, hears the mourning wail of the whales. Tears fill the eyes of the alienated rebel as he gazes on the ephemeral mayfly. The weary matador with bloodied hands has his torso pierced by the horns of the bull. The maddened dance merrily at the razor's edge between consciousness and dream land… Here, you can witness the amorphous nature of life brought into reality with ardent passion, and its mystery tenderly unraveled with overflowing compassion for its very existence. And this is only the bare bones of Hua Hua's wonderful musical world!

You can transcend the limits of the individual self to experience the mysticism of a world majestic in its grandeur: Become the giant deer that holds the blue planet in its embrace, the god tree that stands spectator to the collapse of all creatures on Earth, or even the deity that guides blooming innocence into broad daylight.

In Hua Chenyu's world of music, you shall feel his feelings: the romantic, pure, epic, holy, depraved, insane, dark emotions in their sublimity, indiscriminately overflowing with beauty and love.

欢迎走进华晨宇的音乐世界，他是当代中国最具关注度的艺术家之一。

他前卫而多变的音乐风格，极具特色和感染力的表演，和包容万物的处事哲学，是他的三把利剑，使得他能在低迷的音乐市场中披荆斩棘，几万人的演唱会一票难求。在他的音乐世界里，一切都不同寻常。孤独的卡西莫多会听到鲸鱼的哀鸣，叛逆的异类会流泪注视着玉石俱焚的蜉蝣，满手鲜血的斗牛士疲惫的胸膛会被另一只牛刺穿，半梦半醒的疯子在崩溃边缘跳舞......

在这里，生命的各种处境都得到精彩的呈现和悲悯的解构。然而，他的音乐还不止于此！你甚至可以超越自身，从而体验一种神话般的浪漫和宏大：你可以是一只把蓝色星球捧在手心凝视的一只巨鹿，可以是见证万物崩坏生灵涂炭的一棵神树，更可以是云端指引懵懂生灵奔向宽宥白昼的神明。

你可以在他的音乐世界里感受浪漫的，纯净的，宏大的，圣洁的，扭曲的，疯狂的，黑暗的等种种各异却毫无例外都洋溢着爱与美的一切情感。
