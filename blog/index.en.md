One of the most influential artists in China, Hua Chenyu draws you into his world of music.


In his arsenal are avant-garde compositions, striking and entrancing performances, and all-encompassing philosophical attitudes towards all things. Music lovers from around the world clamor to fill the seats by the tens of thousands at his signature Mars Concerts as he cuts a blazing path through the dense fog of the tortuous music market.
 

In this world of music, everything tilts into the unusual. Quasimodo, in his loneliness, hears the mourning wail of the whales. Tears fill the eyes of the alienated rebel as he gazes on the ephemeral mayfly. The weary matador with bloodied hands has his torso pierced by the horns of the bull. The maddened dance merrily at the razor's edge between consciousness and dream landâ€¦ Here, you can witness the amorphous nature of life brought into reality with ardent passion, and its mystery tenderly unraveled with overflowing compassion for its very existence. And this is only the bare bones of Hua Hua's wonderful musical world!


You can transcend the limits of the individual self to experience the mysticism of a world majestic in its grandeur: Become the giant deer that holds the blue planet in its embrace, the god tree that stands spectator to the collapse of all creatures on Earth, or even the deity that guides blooming innocence into broad daylight.


In Hua Chenyu's world of music, you shall feel his feelings: the romantic, pure, epic, holy, depraved, insane, dark emotions in their sublimity, indiscriminately overflowing with beauty and love.
