 《Heyhwadong》
     惠化洞

Composer and Lyricist: Jin Chang Ji
Piano: Park Bo Gum
Singer: Hua Chenyu

Suddenly my childhood friend
called and told me
that he would go far away tomorrow

We wanted to visit the little street together
where we used to play games
He told me that he would go far away tomorrow

So I boarded a rocking train
and went to that little street
Along the way, I was thinking about
how we had been growing up
but forgetting at the same time
My dear friend was there
on the same little street where everyone has gone

With a smile, he walked toward me with his arms open
just like when we were kids
We went to visit the place where, in our childhood, we used to dream
and look forward to the future
Yet you told me
that you would go far away tomorrow
We once pinky-promised
we would return to this place one day

Yet you told me
that you will go far away tomorrow
So I boarded a rocking train
and went to that little street

Along the way, I was thinking about
how we had been growing up
but forgetting at the same time
My dear friend was there
on the same little street where all people have gone

With a smile, he walked toward me with his arms open
just like when we were kids

La La La La La

Along the way, I was thinking about
how we had been growing up
but forgetting at the same time

La La La La La

Along the way, I was thinking about
how we had been growing up
but forgetting at the same time
