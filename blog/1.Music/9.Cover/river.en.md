When you lay down flat, I turn into a river

which meanders through the valley of your neck 
and evaporates near your lips

Secretly thinking of your eyes
I can't let go of my longing

All flows into a fountain, so deep and crystal clear

When love is scorching the plain
Slowly you turn

Settling down on the rich riverbed
A pilgrim is who I am

I am a migrating goose
Yet my deep longing never ends

I no longer have the will
to chase the spring in fresh green color

Let me flow

Like the layers of a glacier

Exchanging a billion years for a few moments--
I would still eagerly wait for you like this

Wait till the dusk of life

Wait till oblivion

Wait till the princess kisses her frog

As the spell gradually dispels
wholeheartedly you laugh

How ravishing it is
Like a missing piece from Heaven

I fold my wounded wings and walk out of the riverbed

You are proudly telling the world that love can be found right here

Let me flow

Like the layers of a glacier

Exchanging a billion years for a few inches--
I would still eagerly wait for you like this

Wait till the dusk of life

Wait till oblivion

Wait till the princess kisses her frog

When the spell gradually dispels
wholeheartedly you laugh

How ravishing it is 
like a missing piece from Heaven

I fold my wounded wings and walk out of the riverbed

You are proudly telling the world 
that love can be found right here

You are proudly telling the world 
that love can be found right here
