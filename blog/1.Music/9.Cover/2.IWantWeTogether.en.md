《I Want Us to Be Together》
      我要我們再一起

Composer and Lyricist: Li Quan
Covered by Hua Chenyu

From afar, winds are blowing on my face
my hand, my hair, my heart, and my eyes
From afar, you are staying in that city
on that road, in that house, under that lamp and in that window

Quietly, I am playing the CD that you gave me
Music weaves in the background
No matter how I sing
It is not moving anymore
I remember that you used to close your eyes and hold me
As if I were your face
Your smile

I didn't know how to smile at you
Cry to you with an open mouth
And ignore you like a machine

Your world and my life
It seems that we never lost temper with each other
It all went too fast
No time was left

Ai yo, ai yo, ai yo, ai yo, ai yo
Tell me, tell me
Should we or shouldn't we be together?

In tender moments
Life was effortless
Looking at you mindlessly
I only wanted to be with you

Ai yo, ai yo, ai you, ai you, ai yo

Tell me, tell me
Should we or shouldn't we be together?

Ai yo, ai yo, ai yo, ai you, ai yo

Tell me, tell me
Should we or shouldn't we be together
In tender moments
Life was effortless
Looking at you mindlessly
I only wanted to be with you

Ai yo
Ai yo, ai yo
Ai yo
Ai yo

Tell me, tell me
Should we or shouldn't we be together?
In tender moments

Life was effortless
Looking at you mindlessly

I only wanted to be with you
Unlike right now, only from afar can I sing about you
