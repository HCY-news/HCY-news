《Do It While You Are Still Young》
       趁你还年轻

Theme Song of "Up in the Wind"
Lyricist and Composer: Hou Dejian
Singer: Hua Chenyu

Do it while you still don't need to mull things over and over
Do it while you still don't understand the reason for sighing
Do it while you haven't learned to pretentiously prove yourself

You are whatever you think of yourself
Maybe you don't believe it
Maybe you have never noticed
how many people are envious of you
Envious of your youth

This world belongs to you
Just because you are young
You have to grasp your chances
It will not be easy to come back

Do you know why some people are envious of you?
It's just because once they were also young
Do you know why some people are jealous of you?
It's just because they couldn't grasp their chances

Do it while you still don't need to mull things over and over
Do it while you still don't understand the reason for sighing
Do it while you haven't learned to pretentiously prove yourself

You are whatever you think of yourself
Maybe you don't believe it
Maybe you have never noticed
how many people are envious of you
Envious of your youth

This world belongs to you
Just because you are young
You have to grasp your chances
It will not be easy to come back

Do you know why some people are envious of you?
It's just because once they were also young
Do you know why some people are envious of you?
It's just because they couldn't grasp their chances

Do it while you still don't need to mull things over and over
Do it while you still don't understand the reason for sighing
Do it while you haven't learned to pretentiously prove yourself

You are whatever you think of yourself
