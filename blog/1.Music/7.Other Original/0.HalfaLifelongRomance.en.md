《Half a Lifelong Romance》was tailor-made for Karen Mok by Hua. After listening, it felt like watching a movie!

In 2015, Hua Chenyu wrote a song at home and named the demo "Karen Mok". The two had not met yet but he felt that she was the only suitable candidate for the song. They would meet a year later at the filming of "The Next", with Mok being pleasantly surprised by Hua's little shoutout to her character Bak Jing-jing in A Chinese Odyssey in the song "Great Sage Equal to Heaven". This is how their story began, with two awe-inspiring talents admiring each other on one stage.

Mok reached out to Hua in 2017 to write a song for her and he finally handed her the demo that was meant for her all along. She said that the song represents a special bond between them, they truly embody its essence of the "Half a Lifelong Romance". Written by a fated companion and featuring her signature profound and emotional vocals, this song wasincluded in Mok's 25th Anniversary album. Despite their half a lifelong age gap, they seem to have known each other for a lifetime in this unbreakable bond.

2015年，华晨宇在家创作了一首歌，当时两人尚未相遇，华晨宇却为这首demo取名《莫文蔚》，这是一首非她唱不可的歌。隔年天籁之战开录，两人有机会相遇，华晨宇改编《齐天大圣》歌词的一句「欠白晶晶的笑容染红的夜空，化作心底入梦的彩虹…」让莫文蔚惊呆了笑，一个舞台，两个世代，折服彼此的歌唱才华。

2017年莫文蔚向华晨宇邀歌，这首以她为名的demo终于交到她的手上，莫文蔚曾说，曲如缘分，他们是真正的《半生缘》，并把歌曲收录在她25周年的专辑中，这半生的音乐生涯由一个忘年之交谱曲，环绕着莫式唱腔的沉稳、情感层层递进...他们的年龄虽隔了半生，却仿佛相熟了一世，知音知情。

#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《Half a Lifelong Romance》
         半生緣

Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Francis Lee
Producer: Arai Soichiro

The second half broke away
from the first half of life
Life is a chain of losses

Your beloved left without bidding farewell
How long can a lifetime last?

Hah~

Finally, you and I
At this place, we met
Finally, we did not just miss
each other once more

Doubt is tearing myself apart
Life is an endless wasteland
Whether you are there or not
This my, my ordeal

Finally, you and I
At this place, we met
Maybe you are my
unfulfilled wish

Finally, you and I
Met at the mid-point of a lifetime
Just so you and I can see
Our truest side

Ah~

There is no turning back and I have to move on
Yet the half of a lifelong romance
has become the eternity
