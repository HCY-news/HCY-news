From the set of songs sent by the copyright company, he noticed this demo, along with its soft and whispering sense of narration. He felt that it isn't a grand song, yet is still one that is full of emotion. The demo gives a feeling of soul music, with simply a guitar accompanying the chanting. Lyricist Ronald is a novice in his field and during his two years in the UK, he was influenced by the 90's pop, R&B, and soul music singers and songwriters. He was eager to "integrate feelings and emotions into the song" and was determined to become an inspiring songwriter.

The requirements for the lyrics can be summed up to two words: "simple" and "love". Dai Yuedong emailed the lyrics in the middle of one night in June, writing, "You might laugh when you read the lyrics. Fairy tales, little frogs. I don't think that any person other than I would write about such an interesting theme~ I kind of am willing to try what others don't even dare to think about~ Only like this will it be interesting~ Haha". "I think that it's more interesting to sing a song that is unfettered as this; plus it's also not quite seen in the record market, is it?" At his concert, Hua Chenyu also expressed that he loved the lyrics at first site.

版权公司投来的一批歌里，听到这首小样，娓娓道来的倾诉性，不是一首多大的歌，却很动人。小样里就伴着一把吉他的吟唱，soul的感觉。曲作者Ronald 是新作者，在英国呆了两年。受到90's流行，节奏蓝调，灵魂乐的歌手以及词曲作者的影响，渴望"将感觉与情感融入歌曲中"，立志变成有感召力的词曲人。

收词的要求，其实概括来讲，就是四个字"简单，爱情"。代岳东6月某天夜半发了歌词，邮件正文里写道 "这个歌词 你看了可能会笑，童话，小青蛙，我觉得这么有趣的题材，除了我，应该不会有人写了~比较乐于尝试别人不敢想的~ 这样才有意思~ 哈哈"。"我觉得这种天马行空比较有趣，唱片市场都少有吧。" 华晨宇也在演唱会上亲口说了对这个词的一见钟情。

《Bedtime Story》
    枕边故事

Composer: Ronald Tsui
Lyricist: Dai Yuedong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

Let me gently
Tell you a Bedtime Story

Once upon a time, there is a long-haired princess
Who secretly falls in love with a frog
Every day the frog would sing for her
Neither the king nor the queen approves of him
But the princess says, he is my beloved
I cannot bid him farewell just so

Who knows
The little frog turns into a prince
The prince takes his princess away from the palace
They elope to a land
where they can live in peace
And the two of them
Live happily ever after
This is his and their fairy tale

Woo~~ Woo~~
Woo~~ Woo~~
Woo~~ Woo~~
Woo~~ Woo~~

Who knows
The little frog turns into a prince
The prince takes his princess away from the palace
They elope to a land
where they can live in peace
And all of them
Live happily ever after
This is mine and yours fairy tale

Woo~~ Woo~~
Woo~~ Woo~~

Tomorrow too I will tell you
Another Bedtime Story
Tonight even the moon is sleepy
whispering in your ear, good night
