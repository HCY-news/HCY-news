This was a song that Hua Chenyu was very determined to use among the selection of demos sent to him. Repeatedly adopting changes of the music phase and switches of the left and right soundtracks, this is a new metal rock song containing a bit of electronic elements that is suited for listening with headphones.

This song, with its fast beats and new metal style, contains a verse and a chorus that is highly disparate with each other: the verse being more electronic and the chorus being more rock. Producer Bernard Zheng also amplified the guitar, increased the number of segments, and arranged the interlude in a very interesting way. Furthermore, the song employs a lot of changes in the phase of the music, and the segmentation and variation of the left and right soundtracks makes it exceptionally cool. This piece, though written in a high-spirited manner, is also a test of singing skills. The verse is sung relatively fluidly, while the chorus requires a lot of explosive power. The most difficult component is that the song is in the treble range from beginning to end, which poses a challenge for Hua Chenyu. During the recording, however, Hua Chenyu sang with a lot of alacrity and was able to flawlessly depict all the details that were initially difficult to grasp.

《不朽》
这应该是华晨宇自己比较喜爱的一首作品。虽然后来他尝试过很多音乐风格，但实质上他本人应该是比较偏爱摇滚的。

通常来说，喜欢摇滚的音乐人也能很容易掌握流行抒情类的音乐，但习惯流行类音乐的歌手却很难通透摇滚音乐的精髓。华晨宇无论在哪个音乐间隙里唱一两句摇滚风，那股纯粹的摇滚味就会扑面而来。所以他骨子里是个摇滚音乐人。
这首歌属于带点电子的新金属摇滚，其中的激情、个性、自信非常凸显。这种沸腾张扬的锐气只有年轻人才有，也被华晨宇极好地在音乐中释放了出来。

《Immortal》
   不朽

Composer :Dúné
Lyricist: Guo Deziyi
Arrangers: Bernard Zheng,Dúné

Life is an excuse
Threatening us to give it all up
I'm stretched thin
But I get it get it

I am immortal
Although in your eyes
I am nothing but a trapped beast
I should be immortal

Only by seizing eternity can I be satisfied
I'm above being a lowly clown
Cowardice is not an excuse
To let me quit quit quit to fight
As time decays
Sorry, but I get it get it

I am immortal
A curse that takes over all rationality
Like a black hole that devours all
I should be immortal
I refuse to be forgotten by reality
I'm above being a lowly clown

I am immortal
Should be engraved into memory forever
Served without reservations
I should be immortal
Forever worshipped by all beings
I have the perfect freedom

I am immortal
Should be engraved into memory forever
Served without reservations
I should be immortal
Forever worshipped by the world

I have the perfect freedom
I'm immortal to begin with
Why should I compromise or yield
Now it's your turn to kneel down
Say you get it get it
