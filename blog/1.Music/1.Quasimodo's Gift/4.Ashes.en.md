The copywriting of Hua Chenyu's first album was written by Wu Mengzhi. All tracks are connected with the concepts of thunder, rain, smoke, dew, light and dream, and the concept of this song is smoke.

When Hua Chenyu heard Xilou's demo, he felt that the melody was very suitable for him and decided to include it to his album. The demo written by Xilou is not a regular song. What he writes is very jumpy and does not follow the routine.

When arranger Bernard Zheng got this demo, he felt that it was a coincidence. He knew Xilou and felt that Hua Chenyu's jumping thinking was very similar to him. In order to keep the original feeling, he called Xilou and asked him to help arrange this song. Xilou and Bernard made the second arrangement together. Xilou stayed with Hua Chenyu's entire recording process and also recorded the harmony for this song.

Singing this song is not as easy as it sounds. In order to achieve the psychedelic effect, Hua Chenyu recorded so many times till he got a hoarse voice.

Albert Leung was the judge when Hua Chenyu participated in the competition for the Spring Festival Gala. He was very impressed with his singing. He watched many of Hua's videos and articles. During the recording, Albert Leung based on Hua Chenyu's more sticky characteristics and the recorded version of the arrangement, he changed the lyrics three times to bring the feeling closer to Hua Chenyu's inner world.

The song titled "Ashes from Fireworks" is inherited from the "I am What I am" that Hua Chenyu covered in the SuperBoy 2013 competition

华晨宇的首张专辑文案由吴梦知撰写，所有曲目以“雷雨烟露光梦”的概念联接，而这首歌的概念为烟。

华晨宇在小样中听到西楼的DEMO，就觉得作者细腻的旋律线条甚至声音都很适合自己，遂决定收录。西楼写的小样不是很常规的歌，他写的东西很跳跃，不按套路出牌。这首歌是他在2012年经历了很多事情，很灰暗低落的时候，用音乐慰藉自己有感而写。而这首歌的编曲郑楠拿到这首小样时，觉得很巧，西楼他认识，觉得华晨宇和西楼的跳跃性的思维很像。

为保持原有小样的迷幻，给西楼打电话，说过来帮我吧，西楼第二天就从外地赶到北京，和郑楠一起做第二次编曲。认真的西楼在华晨宇录音录制过程中全程坚守，还录了和声。这首歌没有听起来那么好唱，为了达到空远迷幻效果，华晨宇录音录到声音沙哑，经历了5次混音修改。

林夕是华晨宇参加直通春晚时的评委，对他的演唱印象深刻，受邀填词立即答应，还看了他的很多视频和详细的文字介绍。在正式录音后，林夕根据华晨宇唱歌比较黏连的特点和编曲后的录音版本，三易其稿，让歌词更接近华晨宇的内心世界。歌名《烟火里的尘埃》脱胎于华晨宇比赛中翻唱的《我》，传承烟火的续篇。

《Ashes from Fireworks》

Composer: Xi Lou
Lyricist: Albert Leung
Arranger: Xi Lou, Bernard Zheng

Watching the dancing ashes fall down
No one notices how free and unbounded their existence is
But the whole world loves the bustle
and cannot stand my listlessness

I shouldn't be alone, falling in a trance
Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom

Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise

Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
What is there that should be or shouldn't be?

In my heart, there lives an elderly child
If the world cannot comprehend me,
then I would confess to the shadow

Am I the only one still asking
Why tomorrow will be more dazzling?
In the fireworks, no remnants of innocence can be found

Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom

Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise

Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
There's only me
Who is just me
How strange

I am still sighing
Gusts of wind are blowing past
Why doesn't it come back?
The wind leaves and never returns
Isn't it sad?
We become numb so fast
Should or shouldn't it be?
Can it slow down?

Laugh whole heartily
Cry frankly
Why should my expressions be arranged
by this world?

I am just me
I am only me

Just the falling ashes from an outburst of fireworks
Gusts of wind are blowing past
The wind leaves and never returns
Can it slow down?
