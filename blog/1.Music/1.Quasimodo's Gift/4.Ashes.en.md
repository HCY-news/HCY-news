The lyrics of "Ashes From Fireworks" were written by Albert Leung. All tracks are connected by the concepts of thunder, rain, smoke, dew, light and dreams, and the concept of this song is smoke.

When Hua Chenyu heard Xilou's demo, he felt that the melody was very suitable for him and decided to include it to his album. The demo was not a conventional song but very "jumpy". It does not conform to the routine. Xilou wrote the song in 2012 when he was going through a difficult time. 

When the arranger Bernard Zheng received this demo, he felt that that this was a fortuitous coincidence. He knew Xilou and felt that he and Hua Chenyu's jumping type of thinking was very similar. In order to preserve the original feeling, he called Xilou and asked him to help arrange this song. Xilou and Bernard completed the second arrangement together. Xilou stayed with Hua Chenyu throughout the entire recording process and also recorded the harmony for this song.

Singing this song is not as easy as it sounds. In order to achieve the psychedelic effect, Hua Chenyu recorded it so many times that his voice became hoarse.

Albert Leung was a judge when Hua Chenyu participated in the competition for the Spring Festival Gala and was deeply impressed by his singing. After being invited to write for this album he watched many of Hua's videos and read many articles. After the official recording, Albert Leung, based on Hua Chenyu's more "sticky" characteristics and the recorded version of the arrangement, changed the lyrics three times to bring them closer in feeling to Hua Chenyu's inner world.

The song entitled "Ashes From Fireworks" was borne from the song "I am What I am" covered by Hua Chenyu during the SuperBoy 2013 competition.

《烟火里的尘埃》
这首歌是曲作者西楼在个人人生低潮期为了慰藉自己创作出来的作品，并呈现了现实世界之外幻想空间迷离的美丽。
词作者林夕是极为优秀的词家，其填词与华晨宇富有感染力的演唱一起，赋予了这首歌更丰富的灵魂——也许我们只是凡俗烟火里不起眼的尘埃，看着世界热闹快乐，内心却受伤如同苍老的小孩，感慨风吹过后，一去不再回来。
这首歌听起来热闹炫美，内核却是孤独的。这不是某种情感，而是人有时候涌上来的一种情绪——与外界完全疏离，想要尽情宣泄一场的冲动，以及深深的疲倦与悲哀。

这首歌后来成为华晨宇的经典作品之一。

《Ashes From Fireworks》

Composer: Xi Lou
Lyricist: Albert Leung
Arranger: Xi Lou, Bernard Zheng

Watching the dancing ashes fall down
No one notices how free and unbounded their existence is
But the whole world loves the bustle
and cannot stand my listlessness

I shouldn't be alone, falling in a trance
Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom

Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise

Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
What is there that should be or shouldn't be?

In my heart, there lives an elderly child
If the world cannot comprehend me,
then I would confess to the shadow

Am I the only one still asking
Why tomorrow will be more dazzling?
In the fireworks, no remnants of innocence can be found

Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom

Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise

Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
There's only me
Who is just me
How strange

I am still sighing
Gusts of wind are blowing past
Why doesn't it come back?
The wind leaves and never returns
Isn't it sad?
We become numb so fast
Should or shouldn't it be?
Can it slow down?

Laugh whole heartily
Cry frankly
Why should my expressions be arranged
by this world?

I am just me
I am only me

Just the falling ashes from an outburst of fireworks
Gusts of wind are blowing past
The wind leaves and never returns
Can it slow down?
