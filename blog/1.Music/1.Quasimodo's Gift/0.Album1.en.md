When preparing the album, Hua Chenyu himself thought of the album titled "40 Size", and the 40 size is his own shoe size. He felt that a person does not need to have too much space in the world, because you only have two 40-yard feet, and you only need to stand in such a space. It is good enough to go with the flow.  Because as long as you stand here, your existence is valuable.  Later, when he got the lyrics of the song "Quasimodo's Gift", he liked it very much. It was the feeling he wanted, and it was very close to the melody of the song. He decided to use this name for the album. He hopes everyone learns to accept the so-called bad things, because they may also have its beauty in it. Everything has two sides, learn to see the good side of it.

#### Production

Among the ten songs on the album, three were Hua's original including "Why Nobody Fights", "Let You Go" and "Quasimodo's Gift". In addition to composing for this album, he also participated in the entire production of this album and selected the other 7 songs from the nearly 20,000 demos. The production of the album lasted 9 months.  The producer of the album is Bernard Zheng. He arranged for nine of the songs, in the style of rock and roll, as well as the most concise and affectionate piano and guitar versions."

#### 关于专辑名

筹备专辑的时候，华晨宇自己想的专辑名叫《40码》，40码是他自己的鞋码。他觉得一个人不需要拥有太广的天地，因你只有两只40码的脚，只需要站在这么一个位置。顺其自然地活着就很好，因为只要站在这里，你就是存在的，是有价值的。后来拿到同名曲《卡西莫多的礼物》的歌词觉得很喜欢，就是他想要的感觉，与曲的旋律线条也很贴近。专辑也用了这个名字，希望大家学会接受那些所谓表面不好的东西，因为他们可能也会有它的美的点在里面。任何的事物都是有两面性的，学会看到它好的一面。 "

#### 唱片制作
在專輯的十首歌曲中，有三首是他為了這個專輯原創的，其中包括《Why Nobody Fights》,《Let You Go》和《卡西莫多的禮物》。除了為這張專輯作曲，他也參與了這張專輯的全程製作，也在近2萬個demo當中選取了7個收錄進他的專輯裡。专辑的制作历时9个月。整张专辑制作人是郑楠，他为其中9首歌曲编曲，既有国际摇滚的风格，也有最简洁深情的钢琴版和吉他版本。
