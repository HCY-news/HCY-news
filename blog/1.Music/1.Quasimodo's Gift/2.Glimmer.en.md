The whole accompaniment for the song "Glimmer" is by a piano, but the tune itself is divided into two, sometimes simple and quiet, sometimes intricate and intense. It highlights the loneliness and struggle of the singer's heart. Hua Chenyu controls the strength of his high voice very subtly.

《Glimmer》
   微光

Composer: Qian Lei
Lyricist: Zhou Jieying
Arranger: Bernard Zheng
 

In darkness
I turn into a tinder
For you
I want to light up the entire starry sky

Following the gentle breeze
I settled in your sweet dreams
With your smile
You hid in my heart

No need for fireworks or starlights
Just ask what is at the bottom of my heart
In this world of mine
Is there a corner
A land afar you've never known?

Perhaps I am just a glimmer
Yet a brilliant light is what
I want to shine upon you

I would rather get hurt
In the darkness of night
Quietly for you
I shine in solitude

Just let me be a glimmer
That gives you splendid lights
In times of loneliness
In whichever way you fly
Bloom will I
To give you an endless glimmer

No need for fireworks or starlights
Just ask what is at the bottom of your heart
In this world of mine
Is there a corner
A land afar you've never known?

Perhaps I am just a glimmer
Yet a brilliant light is what
I want to shine upon you

I would rather get hurt
In the darkness of night
Quietly for you
I shine in solitude

Just let me be a glimmer
That gives you splendid lights
In times of loneliness
In whichever way you fly

Bloom will I
To give you an endless glimmer
