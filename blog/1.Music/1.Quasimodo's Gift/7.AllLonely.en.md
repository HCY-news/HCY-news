This song uses chanting to show the inner loneliness, with "rain" being the main theme of the whole song. With a simple piano tune, who can understand his pain? How much he wants to be stable, we are all lonely", to sing his inner emotions. Without too much intentional singing skills, it sounds very casual.

《我们都是孤独的》
这是首音乐非常优美的歌曲，在强有力的弦乐的烘托下，孤独的气氛十分浓厚。歌词描述了一个孤独的人在雨夜里独自行走，无人关心，他希望最终获得一份安稳。

华晨宇在演唱中做到了对孤独的一种演绎，但或许是因为年龄和歌词的缘故，这份演绎显得单薄了一点。相信四十岁以后的华晨宇再来唱这首歌，感觉会醇厚得多。

《We Are All Lonely》
  我们都是孤独的

Composer: The Blue Van
Lyricist: Dai Yuedong
Arrangers: The Blue Van, Bernard Zheng

He forgot the way home
He was the only one left on the streets
Wandering

He once held in his arms
The person he met and then lost in life
How sad

The rain is falling
Falling, all night long
He keeps his silence

His silence
His pains, who can understand?
His dreams, no one cares
How desperately he longs
Longs for a simple life

He has grown weary
So he lives in his own world
How naive

He understands
God has closed a window
And opened another door for him
Waiting

The rain is falling
Falling, all night long
He keeps his silence
His silence

His pains, who can understand?
His dreams, no one cares
How desperately he longs

Longs for peace of mind
How desperately he longs
Longs for peace of mind

The rain is falling
Falling all night long
He keeps his silence
His silence

Pains in the heart, who can understand?
Whose dreams, no one cares
How desperately he longs
Longs for peace of mind
We are all, we are all lonely
