# We are All Lonely {title}
![background](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/21/N3VNL9.jpg)

This song uses chanting to show the inner loneliness, with "rain" as the main theme of the whole song. With a simple piano tune, who can understand his pain? How much he wants to be stable, we are all lonely", to sing his inner emotions. Without too much intentional singing skills, it sounds very casual.

这首歌用吟唱的方式展示内心的孤独，以"雨"为整曲意境，简单的钢琴曲调，述说着“雨在下，在下，在下一整夜，他不作声，不作声，他的痛有谁能懂。他多么想多么想安稳，我们都是孤独的”，来唱出内心情感。没有过多刻意的演唱技巧，听起来十分随性，

#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《We Are All Lonely》
  我们都是孤独的

Composer: The Blue Van
Lyricist: Dai Yuedong
Arrangers: The Blue Van, Bernard Zheng

He forgot the way home
He was the only one left on the streets
Wandering

He once held in his arms
The person he met and then lost in life
How sad

The rain is falling
Falling, all night long
He keeps his silence

His silence
His pains, who can understand?
His dreams, no one cares
How desperately he longs
Longs for a simple life

He has grown weary
So he lives in his own world
How naive

He understands
God has closed a window
And opened another door for him
Waiting

The rain is falling
Falling, all night long
He keeps his silence
His silence

His pains, who can understand?
His dreams, no one cares
How desperately he longs

Longs for peace of mind
How desperately he longs
Longs for peace of mind

The rain is falling
Falling all night long
He keeps his silence
His silence

Pains in the heart, who can understand?
Whose dreams, no one cares
How desperately he longs
Longs for peace of mind
We are all, we are all lonely
