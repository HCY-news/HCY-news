# Traveling {title}
![background](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/21/N3kVxJ.jpg)

The song is composed by the Danish indie rock band Dúné, full of imagination. The entire song is in the treble area. The repeated rhythm of drumming and high-sounding sound effects, with a chorus of children's voices, makes the song novel and interesting. The rebellious and funny lyrics are full of destructiveness.

该曲是丹麦年轻乐队Dune作曲，曲风属于indierock，充满想象力，整首歌都在高音区。反复节奏的鼓点和击掌声的音效，配有童声的大合唱，令歌曲新颖又有趣，让你瞬间热血沸腾！叛逆而搞怪的歌词充满破坏力和张扬。

#### Lyrics:

《Traveling》

Composer: Dúné
Lyricists: Changyou Meizhihui, Liu Yuan
Arrangers: Dúné, Bernard Zheng

I stand at a crowded intersection
Listening to the crowd's endless quarrels
Arguing over pointless excuses
Arguing over going left or right

I travel around this planet
Watching how time fiddles with hourglasses
I don't want to standstill
I stride forward
Striding towards brilliance

Fly on both feet
Never tire
Soaring, a tenacious flower bud

Fly boldly
Without sorrows
What a bright world

The other shore falls in love with searching
Yet the sky falls in love with running
How dare we fall asleep
How dare we complain

This life is an endless journey
Chasing is in the future of the future
Let's see who will concede
Let's see who will halt their steps
I will stay all the way

Fly bravely
Embrace and kiss the rain
Soaring upwind makes the flight more cherished

Fly gloriously
Embrace and kiss this enchantment

An unwavering flower bud
Soaring blossoms
A blaze in the sky
Few words are uttered

This proud silence
If the march never backs off
Then dreams will not fall down
The self that flies

Fly bravely
Embrace and kiss the rain

Soaring upwind makes the flight more cherished
Fly gloriously

Embrace and kiss the enchantment
An unwavering flower bud
