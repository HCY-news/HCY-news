Since the demo for the song "Let You Go" was written it has not been modified. The song was composed rapidly. One day, right after entering the house, Hua Chenyu sat down at the piano and began to write. With the first harmony, the melody was already in his mind, and, as he played and sang, he recorded it at the same time. In Hua Chenyu's own words it was "a song written in a song's time." After listening to it, producer Bernard Zheng felt that Hua Chenyu's chord usage and his screaming in English both suited the electronic rock style.

The overall atmosphere of the song is magnificent with the arrangement adopting the method of restraining the emotions in the former portion and untethering them in the latter. The long, mysterious, and abysmal introduction engenders a continuous feeling of suppression, until the commencement of the interlude following the beating of the drums, whereby the clamor can once again be reinstated. In order to create a theatrical conflicting effect, numerous layers of drums, guitars, and electronic sounds were used to intensify the contrast. During audio mixing, Ken Lewis cut the rock part of the song weaker, and instead strengthened the electronic components, and finally toned down the guitar.

《Let you go》
作为这首歌的曲创作者，华晨宇自己说，是“一首歌的时间写了一首歌”，所以我们在听的时候，能够感受到音乐前半部分某种随意的流畅性，像是有个念头随随便便溜达着走。

音乐后面的强烈暗黑元素，来自华晨宇年轻灵魂的释放。为了自由，为了理想，为了真实自我，他愿意选择孤独、燃烧和陨落。这是一种很自然的年轻人叛逆精神的坦露。

这个时候的华晨宇，心态上还是相对有些迷惘的，想寻找自己的方向，却还没有完全清楚自己的所需。

《Let You Go》

Composer: Hua Chenyu 
Lyricist: Xia Yuan 
Arranger: Bernard Zheng 

Let you go...

If there is still happiness  
Bury it in the forgotten desert  
If there is still sorrow  
Toss it down the mountain of despair  
What is left that hasn't been swept away yet  
Shadows are all that's needed  
In my isolation  
Giving me company  

Let you go

Stay away from me  
I only live to seek the truth  

Let you go

Nothing can manipulate
My choices

Let you go

Don't try to stop me
My only want
Burn without care of crashing from the skies

Let you go

Don't let my ego
Be rescued

Let you go
