The Demo of this song "Let You Go" is that Hua Chenyu sat directly on the piano as soon as he entered the house and began to play.

When the first harmony went down, Hua Chenyu already had a melody in his mind, and then played and sang directly. He recorded it at the same time. And it hasn't been modified since. In Hua Chenyu's own words, it was "this song was composed in a song's length."

After listening to it, producer Bernard Zheng felt that Hua Chenyu's chord usage and his screaming in English were very suitable for electronic rock style.

《Let You Go》这首曲的小样，是华晨宇一进家门就直接坐在钢琴上开始写，第一个和声下去时，华晨宇脑子里就已经有了旋律，然后直接弹完、唱一遍并录下来，之后便再也没有弹过，用华晨宇自己的话来说，就是“一首歌的时间写了一首歌”。制作人郑楠收到后，觉得华晨宇的和弦用法和他英文“乱”唱嘶吼的方式，很适合走电子摇滚曲风，在编曲上采用了前抑后扬的方法，整体大气磅礴，歌曲前面，神秘浑厚的低频铺底，铺垫特别长，一直压抑着，一直到间奏鼓出来后，再暴躁起来，后面用电子音色和吉他，用了很多层次的鼓，为了有剧烈的戏剧般的冲突，前后落差很大。Ken Lewis在做混音的时候，把歌曲的摇滚部分削的更弱些，反而把电子成分加的更重，最后把吉他做了削减。

《Let You Go》

Composer: Hua Chenyu 
Lyricist: Xia Yuan 
Arranger: Bernard Zheng 

Let you go...

If there is still happiness  
Bury it in the forgotten desert  
If there is still sorrow  
Toss it down the mountain of despair  
What is left that hasn't been swept away yet  
Shadows are all that's needed  
In my isolation  
Giving me company  

Let you go

Stay away from me  
I only live to seek the truth  

Let you go

Nothing can manipulate
My choices

Let you go

Don't try to stop me
My only want
Burn without care of crashing from the skies

Let you go

Don't let my ego
Be rescued

Let you go
