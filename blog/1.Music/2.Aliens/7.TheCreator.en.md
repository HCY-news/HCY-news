《造物者》的Demo最初名为"Weekend Warrior"，歌词原是英文版，后由十禾根据"年轻人的创造渴望"创作了中文版的歌词  。

《造物者》旋律简单、跳跃，流行电音加Rap的音乐风格和上口的曲调都充满年轻节奏和生活态度，脑洞大开的歌词彰显了歌曲的主题：自由的灵魂

#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《The Creator》
    造物者   
   
Composers: Peter Bostrom, Andreas Ohrn
Lyricist: Shi He
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

The cells inside our body are making an uproar
They want to defy gravity all around
Who sets our perception as flat?
Is this world just a trap?

na na na na na na na
The theory of relativity suddenly lost its relevance

na na na na na na na
Mysterious inspiration comes in the blink of an eye

The universe is burning
Things we are used to are all castaway
Our hormones are burning to save our hearts
Be young and boldly creative
To be young is to be creative
To be young is to be creative
To be young is to be creative

I color the anime just right
I scream out loud with the gamers tribe
I will not ditch my unique style
Schrodinger's cat is among my pets
na na na na na na na
My curious nature is my pride

na na na na na na na
My playful nature is out of your hand

My superpower unleashed!
Castaway what we used to see
Our hormones are burning to save our hearts

Be young and boldly creative
Be young and boldly creative
Be young and boldly creative

It's fine as long as our tribe stays true and real
We only take icy cold drinks
and just let bad mood brew

We decide which outfits to wear
We have our own magnetic field symbol
and never compare markers
We have the same brain but not the same pride
Our whimsical party is too wild to be tamed
Our hormones continue to burn to save our hearts
Be young and boldly creative
To be young is to be creative
To be young is to be creative
To be young is to be creative
