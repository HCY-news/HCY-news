《世界是个动物园》是华晨宇写的一首歌，由代岳东填词，这是《你看起来很好吃》主题歌，也是华晨宇第二张专辑《异类》里的一首歌。不管词曲都充满了顽皮色彩，把生活当做有趣的动物园，想象力非凡。华晨宇演唱的时候也用了特别的唱法，使这首歌更显活泼。

《The World is a Zoo》
   世界是个动物园 
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyrics: Dai Yuedong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

Two snails in the convenience store are carrying their school bags 
and discussing math problems

A Shar-Pei dog in the bar is confiding its secrets to a fox

Many, many wonders are slowly being discovered

One, two 
One, two, three, go!

In the airport, where are Miss Ostrich and Miss Peacock going?
In the gym, how many miles of laps does Mr. Frog swim?
In the karaoke bar, pretty cats and handsome dogs 
are keen on all sorts of parties

Everybody
oiai iai iai aio
oiai iai iai aio
oiai oiai oiai aio
oiai iai iai~ aio

The world is like a zoo
A super, super big amusement park
Your eyes will be opened wide

Everything is here
oiai iai iai aio

Going out during rush hour,
you'll see subways and buses crowded with ants
A taxi door opens and a butterfly flies in
An owl is directing when the red light should turn green
Counting one, two, three, go!

The pony and the giraffe just broke up their love relationship
Foreign tourists are asking for directions
but no one can understand them
A polar bear is carrying a camera
taking photos of people on the street

Everybody
oiai iai iai aio
oiai oiai oiai aio
oiai iai iai~ aio

The pig wife stays at home from day to night

The macaw telephone operator speaks Mandarin
like a foreign language

The koala is too lazy to cook and always orders delivery
"Ah~, hello, I'd like to order a pizza"
On the construction site, the moles are making the bing bing bing sound
Tap dancing kangaroos are making the bang bang bang sound
Everyday, at the same time, the mother wolf does her aerobic exercises

Everybody, oiai oiai oiai aio
oiai oiai oiai aio say

The world is like a zoo
A super, super big amusement park
Your eyes will be opened wide
Everything is here

There is no height limit and tickets are free
The world is like a zoo
A super, super big amusement park
Your eyes will be opened wide
You will never want to leave
There is no height limit and tickets are free
There is no closing time 
Don't miss it
All passersby, don't miss it
oiai oiai oiai aio
