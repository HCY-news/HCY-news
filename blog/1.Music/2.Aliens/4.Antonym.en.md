这首灵感来源于作曲者王子失恋的亲身经历，一段感情结束之后病态的情绪成为催化剂，王子把自己关在黑暗中写出了这首走心情歌。写到最后一句时，他内心渐渐释然。在一批一批的收歌过程中，华晨宇听到该Demo很有感觉，做了预留，两个月后，在最后定歌曲的时候，决定把它收录进来。填词人小寒有感而发，为该Demo填写两版词，最后确定了《反义词》。"你的反义词是我，而我的同义词是错"，"并非词穷，也非懵懂，只是疼痛，在体内暗涌"，失恋痛感跃然纸上。

制作人郑楠编曲采用由宁静到暗涌，由简单到递加的手法。以钢琴为主，弦乐后进的简单配合。前奏中钢琴的低音一个一个的慢慢砸下来，拉开了整首歌的序幕，逐渐弦乐进入，编曲看似简单，但十足巧思，钢琴，人声，弦乐三部有主有辅，互相跌宕交织，线条清晰，把更多的声音表现空间留给了华晨宇的人声。 同时，对于这部镜头语言应用相当出色的作品，华晨宇的表现和MV内涵深度，都超越一般的音乐视频。

《Antonym》
  反义词
   
Composer: Wang Zi
Lyricist: Xiao Han
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

It was not loss of words
Nor bewilderment
But the pain ebbing and flowing inside of me
My heart was pierced
Though only by a pinhole
It was enough to freeze my throat

My eyes were getting red
With a timid yet yearning gaze
From your eyes
I forgot my grave wound
Two minutes after breaking up
I indulged you
As a kind of forgiveness towards you

The antonym of you is me
The antonym of leaving is silence
If love has to be fought for
Then you never held on
I pleaded carefully for you to stay
There was no room for blunder
Yet I'm synonymous with mistake
Letting go is synonymous with torment
If love is life
Then I've only been hiding from it

(Interlude)

My eyes were getting red
With a timid yet yearning gaze
From your eyes
I forgot my grave wound
Two minutes after breaking up
I indulged you
As a kind forgiveness towards you

The antonym of you is me
The antonym of leaving is silence
If love has to be fought for
Then you never held on
I pleaded carefully for you to stay
There was no room for blunder
Yet I'm synonymous with mistake
Letting go is synonymous with torment

If love is life
Then I've only been hiding from it
By saying the opposite of what's on my mind
I don't have a ground to stand on anymore
