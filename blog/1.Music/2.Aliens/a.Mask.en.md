#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《The Mask》
  变相怪杰 

Composers: Takuya, Lin Chengyou, Jimmy Fung,
Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Dai Yuedong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

Wipe out the plain makeup
The whole performance
Is drawing to a close
Please give me a few more minutes
To bask in the thunderous applause 
Encore

Mocking me for seeking attention
So what?
I'm not gonna care
Put on another mask to play the clown
The next second
I turn into a monster

Peddling extravagantly
Pouring in my all
Indulge to the max
Gentle to the max
Oh, it's time to leave

WOAH~ OH~
Growl, growl, growl, growl, growl

Mocking me for seeking attention
So what?
I'm not gonna care
Put on another mask to play the clown
The next second
I turn into a monster

Switching characters
Is my trade
Using my absurdity
To vie for your second glance

WOAH~ OH~
Growl,  growl,  growl, growl, growl

My heart is stirring up
I have been conspiring all along
To present you
My alluring appearance
Oh， it's time to leave
