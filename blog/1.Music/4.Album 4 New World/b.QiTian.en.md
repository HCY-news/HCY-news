Theme Song of the Movie Wu Kong

华晨宇在看完影片后，发现孙悟空在电影里不是传统中“大闹天宫”的无敌形象，反而是比较悲剧色彩的人物，失去了所爱之人，并且在不得已的情况下大闹天宫，最终放下自己，戴紧箍咒陪唐僧取经。

他内心情绪起伏，决定用悲情与燃情融合的手法来写这首歌，在家闭关数日，写出了这首中国风和rap元素兼具的《齐天》。

华晨宇在写出了歌曲小样架构后，交由郑楠为歌曲的编曲制作。郑楠邀请了爱乐乐团为该曲录制大管弦乐，还邀请了常成老师在RAP里念诵了六字真言。该曲的全部和声则来自于华晨宇，包括歌曲结束前的高音演唱

《Qi-Tian / Equal to Heaven》
          齐天  
   
Theme Song of the Movie Wu Kong
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricists: Ding Yanxue, Jin Hezai, Fang Hao
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

Sun and moon are recurring
Who has commanded Qi Tian
To let go of gratitude and grudges?

Love and hate string together
I cannot escape from the fingertips
Fingertips (of Buddha)
under the vast sky

May I ask, what are life, death, or karma?
Wherefore was I born?
Why have you brought me forth
Yet will not answer my doubts?

You said: "Become a Buddha at this instant"
If I become a Buddha
Will there be no demons in this world?
Who can tell me?

Look, the sandstorm blocked the sun
and enveloped the world in dust

The moon above Heaven's Palace
is no different from that above Mount Huaguo

I won my first battle with glory and fame
Yet you tried to catch me with inescapable nets

You won without honor
I could not dodge hidden arrows

So many daybreaks have slipped away unnoticed

The ending and truth remain elusive
as I tread forward

Fragrance of peach blossoms
persists in my dreams

Yet it can not resist your trickery

The truth of black and white
is waiting for the daybreak

Can it directly write down
your natural talent (for trickery)?

Daggers and blades were out of sheath
Dragons and phoenixes collapsed as kylins fell

Flight of jade steps shattered
at the swing of my golden cudgel (Qi Tian's weapon)

There is no chance for regret
Over a thousand years and in this universe
Only my golden cudgel is left

Why have my victories ended in loneliness?
Whose name was whispered
by the wind in my dreams

I said, "Excuse me,"
but there is no way I would admit defeat

Treading across the Southern Heaven
I sware upon mountains and rivers

Till the end of the world
Who was young and wild?

Who could give me a belief?
Spring had not ended

The moon was shining
I wanted to bother you

Unfortunately, the wind blew early
I missed my chance

The dawn was just breaking
The constricting headband had not been forged
I can still smile

Love, hate, worries and fear fogged my eyes

Thunders of thousands of soldiers shook the world
But they still could not confine me

Millions of heavenly warriors advanced and spread
Don't even think about my surrender

You cannot decide the victor of this battle
The Heaven's Palace was turned upside down with one swing of my cudgel

To hell with fate
I choose my own destiny

I want these mountains to move away from my inroads
I want these waters to part to make way for my returning path
I want heaven and earth to yield to me

The world shatters at the tip of my cudgel
You picked up a flower with a smile
The sky was filled with dusk clouds

I once cried, laughed, loved, hated,
obsessed and went mad

What is left that I can not let go of?

I want these absurd rules
to end as a farce

One day, under heaven and earth
The stone heart (of Qi Tian) was caught in a paradox

The so-called "nothingness" is the exile at
where we came from

Tide rises and falls
It occurs that "nothingness"
is the so-called "Great Sage Equal to Heaven"
