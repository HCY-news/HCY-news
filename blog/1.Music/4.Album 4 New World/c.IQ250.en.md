这是华晨宇为《王者荣耀》中角色"鲁班七号"创作的主打歌。"当时正看完电影《死侍》，那种贱贱拽拽的性格和鲁班七号的slogan「智商二百五，膜拜，记得膜拜」给我的感觉特别像，我就结合这两个人物写了一首轻松愉快可以让人摇头晃脑听上瘾的音乐。"华晨宇首次尝试雷鬼异域曲风，更加注重旋律的流畅度，抒情与叙事兼备，"现实"的verse部分如同"稳定器"，"魔幻"的rap部分则如同"加速器"。

歌曲A段简单重复的旋律和歌词直铺主题"看世界太平庸我宅到没朋友，直来直去不造作深藏一生追求"，A2-A4段落的华晨宇还特别有意唱出了游戏人物电子声音变速的唱法；B段鬼马淘气，跳跃性朗朗上口的律动及加速带来的速度感和趣味感让你忍不住一起摇头晃脑，间奏和C段出乎意料的采用行进式的小军鼓演奏的仪仗队式奏章，仪式感的大合唱来推高"智商随意收割全场骄傲又嚣张"的激情。对经典意象进行情节消费带来的游戏感让你欲罢不能，彻底掉进属于华晨宇的鬼灵精怪的"发明陷进"中。

郑楠、从编曲上为这首歌曲带来了完整的框架和新鲜感。诸多特色配器的使用，如钢琴、小军鼓，合唱团，电音变化，层次分明，层层递进，最后让歌曲在一声"不和谐"的钢琴键音戛然而止，把听觉的挑逗留在无法终止的兴奋中。

《IQ 250》
智商二五零  
   
Arena Of Valor Archer Hero
Theme Song for Luban No.7

Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Pei Yu
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

Look, this world is too mediocre
That I am a homebody having no friends

Straight-forward and unpretentious
I keep what I pursue for life deep to myself

Forgive me for always being short-circuited and awkward at important moments

Only craziness is to be blamed which needs no rationale

I think my greatest ability lies in my talent in tech
My power to unnerve my opponents is unbelievable even to myself
Betting on my favorite inventions to defy the gravity of the earth's core
For the next season, I sort out my expressions while taking a deep breath

A body

Who is withstanding the pressure of public opinion
Walking swiftly at will?

Don't worry

Never calling it quits will be my only rationality
I wander and jump around with my short legs without hostility

When I sense your relapse, I will command a comeback from the impasse
What can you do?

A body

Look, this world is too mediocre
That I am a homebody having no friends
Straight-forward and unpretentious
I keep what I pursue for life deep to myself
Forgive me for always being short-circuited and awkward at important moments
Only craziness is to be blamed which needs no rationale
I don't understand what are special connections
My adrenaline would rush
My self-peddling and self-praising nerves can't handle a romantic relationship
I melt my brain to sweep through the big game map
Don't dream to attack my territory by reading my mind
Don't hold back and let me warn you, you can't damage me

A body

I can't strike a pose for a handsome picture which can be flattered in nice words
Who says that a quirky nerdy mind is only meant for solving puzzles?

I act cute and silly
When you drop your defense
Unexpectedly, I'll take with justification and win completely

A body

Look, this world is too mediocre
That I am a homebody having no friends
Straight-forward and unpretentious
I keep what I pursue for life deep to myself
Forgive me for always being short-circuited and awkward at important moments
Only craziness is to be blamed which needs no rationale
With my IQ, I can easily beat every enemy on the whole game map
I'm proud and unrestrained
The stauncher I get as a homebody in the dark
The more chart breaking shortcuts can be found to rise to the sky
I never thought of trying too hard and I'm only here because I love this journey
I don't care to be an entertaining freak and my perseverance is not a disease
It is alright, lift up your eyelids to keep your eyes wide open
