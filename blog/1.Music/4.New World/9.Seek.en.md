The Theme song for《Divas Hit the Road 3》It's a song about Seeking.

I went to the desert to find the well-hidden heart
I went to the jungle to find the long-lost land
I went to the wilderness and valley to see the sunset and the sunrise
I see the starry sky is to find the relationship between people

The whole program was about "Seeking", so the song was finally named "Seek"

Hua Chenyu called this song "Love Work of 2017". During the recording process, he took every detail seriously. He recorded this song from 4 pm to 3 am.

From each word's pronunciation to each line's singing method. In order to achieve the best feeling of the song's artistic conception and hearing. The lyrics are different from the conventional form of Chinese songs in the past. Modification to achieve the best auditory effect. Until the middle of the night, Hua Chenyu still insisted on meticulously recording the harmony of one track, and even selected each audio track for the first time. Finally showing us the ethereal temperament of the song.

《花兒與少年3》是一个关于寻找的故事

去到沙漠，是为了寻找砂砾的心中深藏的井
去到丛林，是为了寻找久违的大地
去到荒原和山谷，是为了寻找日落再看日出像刀一样升起
去看星空，是为了寻找人和人之间的关系

整个节目关于"寻找"，歌曲因此最终定名为《寻》

华晨宇将这首歌称作"2017挚爱之作"，在录音过程中极尽细节的认真，反复研磨发音到满意，录制当天从下午四点到凌晨三点，录制过程中悉心琢磨歌词每个字句发音，再次几度调整唱法，而为了达到歌曲意境和听觉上的最佳感受，这次歌词的调整也不同以往中文歌的常规形式，录音过程中词作者也为了演唱和发音做了许多临场的修改，以达到听觉上的最好效果。直到半夜华晨宇仍坚持一轨轨精心单录和声，甚至首次亲自挑选每一道音轨，呈现出歌曲最终的飘渺气质。

Theme Song for Divas Hit the Road S3

Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Shi He
Producer: Bernard Zheng

If there are no winds nor waves by our pillow
How is it that we would tumble and sway?

Without the darkness of moonless nights
How can stars shine so bright?

Footsteps may fade, yet dreams will continue
The sun is still far away, yet it will be there forever
When dawn arrives, we will find the most beautiful wishes

How long will good times last?
Along the road, there is still a faint fragrance
Under the dimming sky,
I can still feel a cooling breeze

How vast is the world?
Behind us, there is still home
Seek a path

Let us fly
Let us fly

Undulating like a song
The scenery on the road shifts and turns

Dialogues among millions
Are replaced with one word: "Wait!"

I cannot see through black and white
But I can hear pendulum swinging

Venturing into a new world
I am my own heart's companion

My own heart's companion

When the wind blows past
Which way are you looking for in the sunset?

I have so many words to say
Yet turning around, I only see a barren desert
Alone, it is hard not to be consumed by wanderlust

Somehow, it had turned into a riddle of the self
The best journeys instill within us the shape of love
How long will good times last?
Along the road, there is still a faint fragrance
Under the dimming sky, I can still feel a cooling breeze

How vast is the world?
Behind us, there's still home
As long as you are by my side

Let us fly
Let us fly

In my dreams of flowers, I see you sitting down
Holding my hands, you led me
to sleep in the vastness of the mountain
After all, a lifetime is only so long
We should try to leave our marks in the world

Let us fly
Let us fly

Like a song, the trip along the road is ever changing
We are exploring
Return yesterday's joys and sorrows to earth
I'll be home when the next spring arrives
To love like a youth
Let's finish our story and grow up

Grow up
Grow up
