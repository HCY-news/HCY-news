The song was composed by Hua Chenyu; it was arranged and produced by Zheng Nan; the lyrics were written by Pei Yu. The song continues the popular rap with progressive reinforced rap and some Rock, criticizing the false and contradictory lifestyle of the real society in the name of "boring people"("I’m Boring"). Hua Chenyu’s rap style. This is the 27-year-old # 华晨宇 # wrote to his own advanced life Flow! When the boring man sings boring music, he returns to realism and criticizes without any concern. Abandoning the vicious attitude of a hothead, the naked clamoring chanting, the change of multiple timbre and span of the tone, let the original gray emotions of life be vented.

"With the growth of age, under the pressure of life, many people see through the powerless and self-willed reality, survival, and hypocrisy of the fittest and greet, there will be a feeling of being unable to keep up. I wrote this song to see what would happen if there is no one around. "This is 27-year-old Hua Chenyu who wrote about his own advanced life Flow. "I'm Boring" vents the gray emotions of life to the fullest.

"How many people are able to understand the emptiness in their hearts, they just live in the moment till they die." "Surely a fool is happy to consume his enthusiasm, and you can earn probation of splattering if you play a stupid play. Afraid of being caught but haven’t yet. It is the stimulus you always seek." The lyrics lively dissect the truth you already know but avoid to mention, and criticize the absurd and hypocritical "adult world " from the perspective of a bystander. "I’m Boring" was named by Hua Chenyu personally. The change of multiple timbre and range of spans inherited his unique popular hard-core rap style. The lyrics exhaled the original gray emotions of life. Zheng Nan’s way of merging the style brings unlimited development opportunities for Hua Chenyu's rap and the cooperation between the two created a fresh and strong sense for the audience.

这首歌由华晨宇亲自作曲，裴育操刀作词，郑楠编曲制作。歌曲延续了递进加强式rap为主加一些Rock的流行说唱，以"无聊人"的名义批判现实社会虚伪矛盾生活方式。

华晨宇本格说唱。这是27岁的#华晨宇#写给自己的生活进阶Flow！当无聊的人唱着无聊的音乐，他重返写实毫不手软批判戏谑。抛去愣头青一样狠毒的态度，赤裸裸的叫嚣式填词，多重音色和音域跨度的变化，把生活原本的灰色情绪发泄得淋漓尽致。

"随着年龄的增加，很多人在生活成长的压力下，看透了诸多力不从心，任性的现实，适者生存与虚伪和逢迎，会有对什么事都提不起劲的感觉，写这首歌，就是想偶尔也试试看旁若无人会怎样。"这是27岁的华晨宇写给自己的生活进阶Flow。《无聊人》把生活原本的灰色情绪发泄得淋漓尽致。"多少人能看懂人心的空镜，只不过活着活着只活出了年龄"，"当真的傻子乐此不疲在消耗着热情，装傻的戏子你可赚到了吐沫飞溅的缓刑，怕被拆穿还没被拆穿本就是你要的刺激"，歌词活生生剖开你早已心知肚明却回避提及的真相，以冷眼旁观生活的视角批判荒谬虚伪的"成人世界"。

《无聊人》由华晨宇亲自命名，多重音色和音域跨度的变化承贯了他独有的流行硬核说唱曲风，歌词把生活原本的灰色情绪发泄得淋漓尽致，郑楠对曲风的融合化为华晨宇的说唱带来了无限发展契机，二人的合作创造着新鲜强烈的听觉快感。

#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《I'm Boring》
    无聊人  
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Pei Yu
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

I'm chewing the most expensive dinner
Too bad I don't care enough for the bill
Trying to please everyone is not a good habit
Why not try and act like no one's around?
Finally I am able to take off the lavish clothing
More like I've unloaded the cumbersome gold bricks
Good or not, I can tell with one look
Don't have to learn to dress like the royals

There's too much nonsense that has nothing to do
with feelings
Too many actions rooted from our environment
Just like an adolescent punished by adults
in the excuse of 
forcing the fifteen-year-old heart to be
more rational than that of an adult

Those sayings, we've heard since childhood
Yet we still can't disobey fate when we grow up
It's not that it's hard to follow the lessons
But rather that reality is too cruel

How many people can understand
the "Empty Mirror" in the mind?

Life has added nothing but age

I grasp in my hands what is unattainable to others
Mocking myself while despising the filthy

If truth ruins the mood
Then I'd rather shut up instead of telling lies

Looking down on those shady deals
Like traps for drugs

That make people's
head spin on full speed at any moment

How to maintain a clear mind
when you're all crazy about fishing in troubled waters?

Pretend to be serious
Wearing a sheep’s skin to carry out your mission

Fools who believe it
waste their passion restlessly

Actors who pretend to be fools
Have you earned a probation from those useless words?

The fear of being exposed right before it happens
That is exactly the excitement you wanted

I'm boring
I just want to be alone, no need to talk

I'm boring
I just want to be alone, no need to smile

I want to gaze at the twinkling stars
And sing "Twinkle twinkle" like other classmates

But my eyes are filled with
the roar of the hypocritical world

I still have so much to do, so many songs to listen to
Yet I nest in the sofa making boring commentaries

Friends

always curse about the unfairness of the world
when drunk

The ridiculous combination reminds me of the past
When my parents finally separated
and me holding my school report, pretending to be calm

Old man, the money you carry
Was it for business or for travel?

Just vent
I've finally found the way to survive

There are always those that talk pretty yet walk away
as deserters

Is it really good to burn the bridges
you've just past through?

As long as one lives, one has to get used to
the suspending case

My head is full of faces vying for spotlight

Fine

I've seen enough selfish aims
And stiff relationships

I've heard enough white lies
and pretentious sophistry

The so-called character
Is not the ambiguity of upbringing

Someone explain why the "good man" pass
became so fashionable
As though getting it determines one’s nature

I'm boring
I just want to be alone, no need to talk

I'm boring
I just want to be alone, no need to smile

I'm chewing the most expensive dinner
Too bad I don't care enough for the bill

Trying to please everyone is not a good habit
Why not try and act like no one's around?
