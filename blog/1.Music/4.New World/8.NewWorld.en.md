---------------------------------

Composed on the eve of Hua Chenyu's sixth anniversary as an artist, 《A New World》is the title song of Hua Chenyu's fourth album and comprises of the summarization of his first five years in the music industry, signifying his entering into a higher stage. This magnificent composition is the distillation of Hua Chenyu's unique understanding of music and the world captured through his eyes. The lyrics convey a sense of transcending beyond the struggles and victories in life; of standing alone at the summit after the arduous climb. The melody presents the complex relationship between sensibility and rationality, the unyielding resolve after the strike of an epiphany, and the uninhibition that defies all and yet encompasses all.

It is worth mentioning that in 《A New World》we hear Hua Chenyu's first incorporation of the imitation of Xun by the human voice. Xun (埙) is one of the oldest wind instruments in China, it makes a pure, reverberating sound that can be soft or rich. Hua Chenyu used his vocals to mimic Xun to allude to breaking free of a confining cage, defiant and unafraid to soar to heights unexplored. The vocalize building layer upon layer shines through unseeing fog to discover a path, the storm of quick rapping hammers on the heart, and his singing voice catches hold of you and brings you rising to meld into the galaxy. Through his music, Hua Chenyu blazes the way to a wild and open-world beyond your imagination, a conception with its every fiber formed from his artistic insights to the world and the self.

《A New World》
    新世界  
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Ding Yanxue
Arranger: Bernard Zheng, Hua Chenyu
Producer: Bernard Zheng

What "human affairs" have been left
after the cold winter?
Greeted and sent away are guests off the stage

Who would still fixate his mind in autumn
when it's spring?

To earn what I want
I used up all that I had
I am the only one who took it seriously

Watched mountains
Weathered storms
I stride ahead alone

Ancient tunes
Allow me to sing

A dream-like freedom
Drink with freedom and sing with freedom
As I turn and stand on top of a mountain
Say it's a new world
It's a new world

Drink with freedom and sing with freedom
As we turn and stand on top of a mountain
Say it's a new world

What "human affairs" have been left
after the cold winter?
Greeted and sent away are guests off the stage

Who would still fixate his mind in autumn
when it's spring?
To earn what I want
I used up all that I had
I am the only one who took it seriously

Time is long
Night is cold
I'm not afraid to fly high
Till the end I ask the sky

A wind-like freedom
Be as drunk as I wish
Be as free as I wish
As I turn and stand on top of a mountain
Say it's a new world
It's a new world

Be as drunk as I wish
Be as free as I wish
As I turn and stand on top of a mountain
Say it's a new world

Oh-hei-ya
Oh-hei-ya
Oh-hei-ya
New world
Oh-hei-ya
Oh-hei-ya
Oh-hei-ya
New world

Bask in this admiration and refined life
Light and darkness are illusions

Bid farewell to this fading starlight
Coming and going are illusions

Gone is the applause that I have received
Rising and falling are illusions

Smile in the face of this cold-eyed observation
Heaven and Earth are illusions

Don't bend
Accept time -- the unavoidable knife in the end

How insignificant life is
A certain kind of walk leads to a certain kind of mountain

No one dares to bet through the ending
Choke out a laugh when the curtain falls
Repeated shows

No wonder the fleeting sensations of freshness are illusions

No matter how you paint and shade the words

Light and dark are illusions
Forgive those who watch for entertainment

Coming and going are illusions

How clamorous the opening stage is
Rising and falling are illusions

How bleak the ending is
Heaven and Earth are illusions

Talking about heroism
There are only stories

Never anything about ever after
In a few moments of indulging

Remembering only what's talk-worthy
Watching from the sidelines never lasts

Survival dictates what is called history
Why not climb down from the mountain?
Smile as I view all things as illusions

Be as drunk as I wish
Be as free as I wish
As I turn and stand on top of a mountain

Say it's a new world
It's a new world

Drink with freedom and sing with freedom
As I turn and stand on top of a mountain
Say it's a new world
