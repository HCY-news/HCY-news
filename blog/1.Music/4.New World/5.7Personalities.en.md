The ultimate single of Hua Chenyu’s fourth album "新世界NEW WORLD" is <Split>. Once again, Hua Chenyu breaks through his limits to present the composition made up of seven genres, seven tones, seven atmospheres that brings to listeners seven powerful experiences in the span of a single song. once again broke through himself, showing the atmosphere of the tone, and experienced seven extreme lives with seven genres and seven sounds. "Under the immense heaven and earth, specks of dust are born." Fate is a series of misleading veils and dead ends, but the flower blooms at the whim of a will that never falters and eyes that only see the truth.

《新世界NEW WORLD》的極致單曲＜七重人格＞，華晨宇再度突破自我，展現大氣基調，以七段曲風，七種音色，體驗了七種極致人生。宿命翻湧成結，一念花開不敗。

《Seven Personalities/split》
   七重人格
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Lyu Yiqiu
Arranger：Bernard Zheng/Hua Chenyu
Producer：Bernard Zheng

Night befalls and insects chirp
See a robin in the sky fly by
The sparrow outside the window
For whom does it mourn?
 
Shut up!
 
If all time is unrecorded leaving not a trace behind
If all ancient books turn blank how could the past be portrayed?
If numbness is to be exposed wounds will bleed afresh
If a man can tamper with his cruel and doomed fate, stamped at birth
 
[Auṃ maṇi padme hūṃ]
the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra
 
[ Auṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ]
the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra
 
Ancient
Present
Heaven
Earth
 
When the Great Chaos first dissipated
clarity, turbidity, black and white were distinguished
birthed specks of dust
 
Ecstasy
Anger
Joy
Sorrow
 
Flourish and decay in endless cycles
Right and wrong, victory and defeat alternate
Hundreds of mundane lifeforms in eons of Samsara
 
The eternal
The bygone
The existing
The unknown
 
From antiquity to future ages prosperity eventually fades
All things bloom with a single move of my thoughts
The great Chaos transforms in thousands of incarnations
 
`Tis none other than this
`Tis none other than this
 
Let me dictate 
It's up to me to dictate
 
All shall vanish and leave only
that completely unrestrained self
 
Who stands in the torrid storm 
and DOES! NOT! HIDE!
 
Bearing unhealed wounds
I dash to the battle on the verge of losing control
For the FI! NAL! ES! CAPE!

For snatching back the lost freedom
I am willing to turn into a beast

If the truth is entirely buried 
no words are uttered
If men could accept succumbing 
to these predestined, doomed fates
 
[ Auṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ]
the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra
 
[ Auṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ]
the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra
 
When tranquility arrives once more
oh how beautiful is this scenery
 
Even stars doth tumble and perish
Utterly pitch-black
 
Like a puzzle
I have lost a piece
with such glaring blankness

Endlessly ruing, till I...have completely...LOST...MYSELF!
