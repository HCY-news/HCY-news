《Madhouse》
   疯人院

Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Lyu Yiqiu
Arranger: Bernard Zheng/Hua Chenyu
Program: Bernard Zheng

After I am utterly destroyed once more
All becomes purer
That shattered feeling
I know

After I escape once more
Escape the prison of the soul
That feeling of breaking free
I know

Quietly savoring, although there is only
A fleeting moment of freedom

I muster up courage like Don Quixote
and declare war loudly to the air in front of me
When suppression is revealed
Welcome to the wild celebrations
Madness needs no compliments
Leave all hypocrisy till Judgement Day
Like the most Baroque rhythm amongst obstinate arts

I wanna know, woh
I wanna know, woh

How could my extremity be saved after being infected by passion?

I wanna know, woh
I wanna know, woh

On the lunch plate, two flies are well dressed
With their very raucous voices, they debate their proof of existence
A backdrop of white time-space, the same repetitive arguments
This fleeting scene is so familiar
Maybe everything before the eyes is just an illusion
Amid chaotic thoughts, the most irrational of them all

I wanna know, woh
I wanna know, woh

How to mingle with the mainstream in a mad world?

I wanna know, woh
I wanna know, woh oh

After I am utterly destroyed once more
All becomes purer
Those shattered feelings
I know, woo, oh, oh

After I escape again
Escape the prison of the soul
The feeling of breaking free
I know
I will try
Calmly drowning
In the gentleness of darkness
Very meticulously playing the melancholic clown
Standing in a corner
Enjoying a fleeting moment of freedom

MAMA

When clamor turns into a mime, the scene becomes a bit strange
Like the dangerous silence in the jungle
Uncovering anxious bodies

I follow the trajectory of time trying to solve the puzzles myself
Those ignored and missed evidences
All point to the ignorant trap of words
How vicious are the beasts in a subjective world?

I wanna know, woh
I wanna know, woh

How could I escape after being hunted?

I wanna know, woh
I wanna know, woh

If a dosage could be taken to extend the madness
I could ignore all shunnings and accusations
Just indulge in completely insane words and phrases

This problem of relativity would follow the logic of Einstein
The conflict is almost suffocating during half-asleep, half-awake nights
All future unknowns will continue to make me conscious of this feeling

I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

After I am utterly destroyed once more
All becomes purer
Those shattered feelings
I know, woo ho ho

After I escape again
Escape the prison of the soul
That feeling of breaking free
I know
I will try
Calmly drowning
In the gentleness of darkness
Very meticulously playing the melancholic clown
Standing in the corner
Enjoying a fleeting moment of freedom

To me
It is so strange
There are too many restraints and possibilities
Let me endure the process of breaking down
Let me be reborn

After I am utterly destroyed again
Everything becomes purer
This feeling of wild passions

I understand it just now
After I escape again

(That moment) is just ushered in
The freedom I am yearning for

After escaping the madness
Ohh, from the beginning
Till eternity
