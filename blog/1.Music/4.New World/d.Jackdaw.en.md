The theme song of TV Drama "Battle Through the Heaven"

The song was written by Ding Yanxue and named after the unique and slightly vicissitudes of the animal concept like "Jackdaw"

As Kafka himself points out, the name “Kafka” "The boy named Crow" ("Kafka" sounds like "kavka", which means "jackdaw", a crow-like bird, in Czech). Jackdaw is harbingers of protection, warning, and advice. More specifically, they signify wisdom that feels as if it is coming from an inner voice or conscience.

Producer Bernard Zheng arranged the song with layered effect, uncomplicated orchestration, and absolutely explosive musical performance. To organize the progressive relationship of rock and roll.

#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《Jackdaw Boy》
    寒鴉少年  
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Ding Yanxue
Arranger: Bernard Zheng, Hua Chenyu
Producer: Bernard Zheng

Like a mime play, the vision is blurred by fog
Evidence of sneaky prying
is fully exposed under the sun
Moonlight is settling down and praying
Crows open their mouth
Mouth Mouth

I pack up my pride and forgive the lame jokes
Just go Just go
Don't exalt heedlessly

I raise my fists in a fighting stance
Aiming at the raging time
Just go Just go
Don't dispute loudly

Waiting for me to cruise around --
fading calligraphy scrolls and
trapped beasts in the final round

When the duel sends its greetings to --
charred smoking pipes and tangled lines of ploys

Fight against tyranny head-on
Rein in childish practice
Then reverse anticipations and premeditations

Playing all kinds of roles
- who assists with malice?
Guides while backstabbing
Take humiliation as medicine
Thank you for letting me see through everything
Don't take me as a fool
A fool A fool

I pack up my pride and forgive the lame jokes
Just go Just go
Don't exalt heedlessly

I raise my fists in a fighting stance
Aiming at the raging time
Just go Just go
Don't dispute loudly

Waiting for me to cruise around --
fading calligraphy scrolls and
trapped beasts in the final round

When the duel sends its greetings to --
charred smoking pipes and tangled lines of ploys

Fight against tyranny head-on
Rein in childish practice

Then reverse the anticipation and premeditation
The world is too long and time too short
What is there that is worth a celebration
It's too late to look back
I have forgotten that there are returning paths
The hardest is to tame oneself
It is better to stop when one wants to cry
Back-flowing tears will turn solid
to guard and protect

I pack up my pride and forgive the lame jokes
Just go Just go
Don't exalt heedlessly

I raise my fists in a fighting stance
Aiming at the raging time
Just go Just go
Don't dispute loudly

Waiting for me to cruise around --
fading calligraphy scrolls and
trapped beasts in the final round

When the duel sends greetings to --
charred smoking pipes and
tangled lines of ploys

Fight against tyranny head-on
Rewrite the mime after the reversal
Let the truth freely play its tune
