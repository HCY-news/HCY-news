In the new album "新世界NEW WORLD" we can hear the new three main viewpoints of Hua Chenyu through his music:

The first viewpoint is that of embracing humanity’s inherent kindness. These three years we have witnessed the rise of Hua Chenyu like an eagle piercing the clouds, but life has not been so kind to him. He has experienced the ebb and flow of the darkness of the human heart and the whiplash life cruelly bestows, but he has matured and grown stronger despite everything. Each one of us faces sacrifices we must make in exchange for growth and maturity, but Hua Chenyu chose to treat the world with kindness. As ancient philosophers have recorded, "Most life in the universe acts out of instinct. The propensity for kindness is a testament to humans’ ability to reach a state of balance with nature through self-reflection. The "intent" for kindness is a representation of humanity’s strength!"

The second viewpoint is the concept of encompassing love. From his new singles <God Tree> and <Arrival> that explores the relationship between humans and the environment, to <Really Want To Love This World> that draws attention on the social issue of depression, and even <Bullfighting> that calls for love and equality towards all living beings, many songs in his new album spreads the concept of all-encompassing love.

The third viewpoint is Hua Chenyu’s worldview he gained through his life experiences. He possesses a sensitivity and keen understanding of his surroundings that he can express through music, this ability born perhaps from his intensely lonely childhood. Six years since his debut, he has matured from the young adult who can only express his inner world through music into the confident artist with a gleam in his eyes that tries to break down all conventions of the mainstream to walk his own path."I look forward to the (Chinese) music industry and its composers and artists catching up with the pace of the music of the world, developing a higher taste in music together with the audience. But first, we the composers would need to lead the way in making new music, before guiding the audience to listen."

这张新专辑《新世界New World》可以听见花花想要表达的音乐新三观：第一观就是向善观，可能因为过去这三年，花花自己的人生也经历了黑暗的低潮期，他感受到自己变得比以前更成熟，每个人都会面临成长的代价，但花花选择用善念来面对一切，就像是某些古代哲学家的记载「事实上在宇宙万物里，大多数的生物行事是出于本能，"性向善"则代表了人可以透过自我反省到达新的自我平衡， "向"代表了人内在的力量！」第二观则是大爱观，从新歌＜神树＞、＜降临＞探讨环保相关的议题，＜好想爱这个世界啊＞关怀忧郁症族群，这一张新专辑有更多歌曲是往大爱的方向去创作，花花希望每个人都能学习爱自己，同时也爱身边的人。

第三观是世界观，也许是因为童年的孤独感造就了他敏锐的音乐嗅觉。出道六年，他从刚出道时那个只会表达自我情绪的敏感男孩，渐渐成长为眼神坚定散发光芒的音乐人，并试图打破以往主流游戏规则的存在，「我期待整个音乐市场上做音乐的人，能够越来越跟得上世界的脚步，品味越来越高，我也希望听众的音乐品味可以越来越高，但前提是，做音乐的人要先去做，才能引领听众去听。」
