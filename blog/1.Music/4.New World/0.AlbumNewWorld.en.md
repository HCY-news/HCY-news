In the new album "新世界NEW WORLD" we can hear the new three main viewpoints of Hua Chenyu through his music:

The first viewpoint is that of embracing humanity's inherent kindness. These three years we have witnessed the rise of Hua Chenyu like an eagle piercing the clouds, but life has not been so kind to him. He has experienced the ebb and flow of the darkness of the human heart and the whiplash life cruelly bestows, but he has matured and grown stronger despite everything. Each one of us faces sacrifices we must make in exchange for growth and maturity, but Hua Chenyu chose to treat the world with kindness. As ancient philosophers have recorded, "Most life in the universe acts out of instinct. The propensity for kindness is a testament to humans' ability to reach a state of balance with nature through self-reflection. The "intent" for kindness is a representation of humanity's strength!"

The second viewpoint is the concept of encompassing love. From his new singles <God Tree> and <Arrival> that explores the relationship between humans and the environment, to <Really Want To Love This World> that draws attention on the social issue of depression, and even <Bullfighting> that calls for love and equality towards all living beings, many songs in his new album spreads the concept of all-encompassing love.

The third viewpoint is Hua Chenyu's worldview he gained through his life experiences. He possesses a sensitivity and keen understanding of his surroundings that he can express through music, this ability born perhaps from his intensely lonely childhood. Six years since his debut, he has matured from the young adult who can only express his inner world through music into the confident artist with a gleam in his eyes that tries to break down all conventions of the mainstream to walk his own path."I look forward to the (Chinese) music industry and its composers and artists catching up with the pace of the music of the world, developing a higher taste in music together with the audience. But first, we the composers would need to lead the way in making new music, before guiding the audience to listen."

Hua Hua's new album "New World". It's been an exhilarating experience that takes us both to the depths of despair and to the heights of Paradise. As a free spirit, Hua's voice roams around the universe. It cries, shouts, and also soothes. Unbridled as the wind, it seeps through our seemingly impenetrable psyche, relentlessly breaks its shell, and invades it surreptitiously. We can't hope to ever root it out again. It grows in our hearts as if it came from there, to begin with. It's the meeting of primitive complementary forces that have been separated long and nothing can subdue this will, this longing for their reunion.

We can only conclude that the appearance of this alien kid is the resurfacing of our negated selves. His alienness is our collective suppressed alter-ego. It's bizarre and logical, emotional and rational, contradictory and harmonious at the same time. We can't really pinpoint what it is in him that enchants us so deeply because it constantly sinks below or barely floats on the surface of our subconsciousness.

While we're unable to sort out a theme from this ramble, we just know that we want to soar with Hua when he sings that “rising and falling are illusions”, “light and dark are illusions”, “coming and going are illusions”, and he will “smile as I view all things as illusions”. Obviously his new world is beyond illusions and in this new world, he will “be as drunk as I wish” and “be as free as I wish as I turn and stand on top of a mountain”. In the cooling breeze at that height, things in our mundane world will recede to their proper proportion and no longer loom large as if they dictate our lives. Who wouldn't want to indulge in that moment of pure liberation? A moment liberated from the illusions of up and down, gain or loss, give or take, popularity or obscurity, the contingencies of the phenomenal world that dissipate as quickly as the smoke which will absolutely leave no traces behind.

The ultimate concealed wound of our life is that we are manipulated by unknown forces that we can't understand and get a grip on, a life that's only bearable by numbness and trivialization. As a result, it's kind of boring and lonely. We are not meant to live complacently in such trivialities. By going against our natural inclinations, our collective anxiety manifests as pettiness, hostility, and stubbornness which is as depressing and demoralizing as a madhouse. We are drowning and the more we struggle with sensationalism and materialism as a defense, the more guilt will surface into our psyche.

But what is our natural inclination? I would say it's the will to control our own fate and that requires us to see through the illusions of life. 

Illusions created by past impressions and current random events. We need to sort out which illusions are bygone, concurrent, transient, and eternal. All of these require us to frequently lift ourselves above the ground, to climb up to the top of the mountain to see better. The view up there is broad and wide. I think that is the new world of Hua Chenyu. It's his new world and it's also ours, our shared new world which is magnificent, serene, breathtaking, and refreshing. Up there, we can regain our sense of control for at least a moment and get the respite we desperately need before diving back to the dizzying and dazzling world down below so that we are not forever controlled by the phantoms that really don't matter to us.

In the song “New World”, Hua tells us that “I am the only serious one.” We have to ask, “Serious about what?” Is he just serious about music? I think it goes beyond music because he has said on numerous occasions that music is relatable to philosophy, cosmology, psychology, math, and many other aspects of life. In other words, he is serious about the general truth of life.

We know that Hua has a ball of fire within, which propels him to pierce through the illusions and seek the truth. This ball of fire can easily burn him and cause excruciating pain. But it's also inspiring in the sense that it magnifies the intensity of everything in life so much more. He lends red a deeper shade of crimson; blue, a more potent hue of the navy; white, a heightened sense of glow; flirtation, an extra load of fun; pain, a higher level of severity; criticism, a bit more poignancy; and care, an additional degree of warmth. Amid the bland days of our life that fritter away like crumbling pigments on an old oil painting, his passionate love and struggles make life so much more vivid as if it has gained a more profound significance and is worth a closer examination. His ritualistic tendencies (even videos have to be released at particular times) makes it feel as if every second of our life counts and has a meaning.

Even if it reveals the pain and raw emotions because it’s ultimately inspiring and uplifting no matter how much it seems as if we want to shun heavy-hearted topics. We really do need this seriousness, because in it there lies something grand, and this grandness is the defining character of Hua Chenyu’s New World.


这张新专辑《新世界New World》可以听见花花想要表达的音乐新三观：第一观就是向善观，可能因为过去这三年，花花自己的人生也经历了黑暗的低潮期，他感受到自己变得比以前更成熟，每个人都会面临成长的代价，但花花选择用善念来面对一切，就像是某些古代哲学家的记载「事实上在宇宙万物里，大多数的生物行事是出于本能，"性向善"则代表了人可以透过自我反省到达新的自我平衡， "向"代表了人内在的力量！」第二观则是大爱观，从新歌＜神树＞、＜降临＞探讨环保相关的议题，＜好想爱这个世界啊＞关怀忧郁症族群，这一张新专辑有更多歌曲是往大爱的方向去创作，花花希望每个人都能学习爱自己，同时也爱身边的人。

第三观是世界观，也许是因为童年的孤独感造就了他敏锐的音乐嗅觉。出道六年，他从刚出道时那个只会表达自我情绪的敏感男孩，渐渐成长为眼神坚定散发光芒的音乐人，并试图打破以往主流游戏规则的存在，「我期待整个音乐市场上做音乐的人，能够越来越跟得上世界的脚步，品味越来越高，我也希望听众的音乐品味可以越来越高，但前提是，做音乐的人要先去做，才能引领听众去听。」
