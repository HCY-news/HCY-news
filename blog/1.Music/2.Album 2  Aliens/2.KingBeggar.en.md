"The King and the Beggar" is a song sung by Hua Chenyu with Yang Zongwei in Hua Chenyu's second album, "Alien." The song was composed by Malaysian co-composer Mike Chan and Faizal Tahir, with the lyrics written by Dai Yuedong.

It was the first time that Hua Chenyu performed a love song on a solo album, and in nearly 10,000 demos, he identified this English version from Malaysian co-composer Mike Chan and Faizal Tahir called "Kings and Queens". 

When the demo was heard the first time, Hua Chenyu and his team all felt that the song was suitable for two people to sing, and Hua Chenyu's first thought was Yang Zongwei, as his tone was very suitable for this song. Dai Yuedong handed over two versions of the lyrics, but decided to use the first version which was suitable for two boys to sing. 

This song's mixing was handled by the American Craig Burbidge, who specializes in Chinese love songs.

华晨宇首次在个人专辑中演绎情歌，在近万首demo里确定了来自马来西亚联合作曲人Mike Chan & Faizal Tahir名为《Kings & Queens》的英文小样。

Faizal Tahir是马来西亚摇滚歌手，他十分喜欢这首demo，一度惜卖，几经考虑，决定将歌曲交给华晨宇唱，希望更多的华人听到这首歌曲。

在第一次听到歌曲小样时，华晨宇及其团队都觉得这首歌适合两个人合唱，而华晨宇第一个想到的就是杨宗纬，认为他的音色很适合这首歌，而杨宗纬受邀后也很爽快的答应合作，只录几遍，就已高质量完成配唱。而华晨宇则用最自然的唱腔，唱出主歌由心而发隐忍的痛与副歌的撕裂

《King and Beggar》
   国王与乞丐

From Hua Chenyu's 2nd Album: Aliens (2015)

Composers: Mike Chan, Faizal Tahir

Arranger: Bernard Zheng

What's wrong? What's wrong?
A love has lost its luster
Face to face, back to back
It hurts no matter how much I struggle

I thought that love is as strong as a rock
Who knew it could shatter in a second
Could it be that even heartaches need constant burnishing?

I, who held you tight
Was wealthier than a king
How happy I once was

I, who lost you
Am poorer than a beggar
How deeply it hurts

Who is crying? Who is laughing?
One person is playing two roles
The more obsessed one is,
the more he is tormented

Memories are still fanning the flames

Knowing that I would fall if I go forward
I return to loneliness with regret
What is left of love in the end?

I, who held you tight
Was wealthier than a king
How happy I once was

I, who lost you
Am poorer than a beggar
How deeply it hurts

When everything has ended,
quietened down, and gone past
Why is my heart still yearning for it?
Who else can feel it?

I, in memories
Was wealthier than a king
In the luxury of happiness

After losing you
I am poorer than a beggar

My heart aches as if slashed by a knife

I miss the times
When you were quietly by my side
The most beautiful waste of tender time

How happy love was
How deep the pain is
How deep the pain is
