"The Giant in Sorrow" appeared in a never unique "native ecological demo" form, composed by Hua Chenyu, the lyrics by Dai Yuedong, A unique creation and refreshing. The whole song was played and sung by Hua Chenyu, accompanied purely by a piano. It's a gift from Hua Chenyu to his fans.

《忧伤的巨人》是专辑《异类》最后曝光的一首歌，也是华晨宇为专辑写的第一首歌，它以一种"从未尝试过的原生态Demo形式"出现，创作独特，让人耳目一新。整首歌曲由华晨宇边弹边唱，纯钢琴伴奏。是华晨宇送给歌迷的礼物。

《The Giant in Sorrow》
     忧伤的巨人

Composer: Hua Chenyu    
Lyricist: Dai Yuedong   
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

There was a giant named Mac Lir
Outside the dwarf kingdom
Living happily in seclusion
His wife hid her secret identity as a mermaid

Until one day
She was brought back into the ocean
Everyday the giant waited for her return
But she never came back

The happy giant
Became upset as days passed by
Everytime the giant was sad

The sky would start to rain
Who knew he stood waiting for years on end
His body
Petrified into islands
His tears
Gathered into seas

Woo~ Woo~
Woo~
Woo~
