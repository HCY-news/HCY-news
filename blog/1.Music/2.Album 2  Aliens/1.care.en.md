《I Don't Care》
   我管你

Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Guo Deziyi
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

I don't quite accept
Not fighting back when wronged
I can't quite conform
To the so-called "mainstream"

Oh~

Tattooed arms or spiked-up hair
Don't tell you all that I am
I don't seek excuses
Those who understand will understand

Oh~

Don't want to explain much
Don't judge me by how I look
Don’t want to explain the misunderstandings
I refuse to talk about "what-ifs"

I Don't Care how you feel
I Don't Care how you feel
I Don't Care how you feel
I Don't Care how you feel

I Don't Care what you think
I am my own expression
I Don't Care about your opinion
My world, I decide how flamboyant it is

Oh~

I Don't Care how fancy you talk
I don't need to be preached by you
I Don't Care what you say
Take me as a fool or a joke
I Don't Care what you do
Don't even dream of knocking me down

Behind so many choices
Despair seems to have no exit
I'd rather clench my fist
Because this is all I have left

I Don't Care how you feel
I Don't Care how you feel
I Don't Care how you feel
I Don't Care how you feel

I Don't Care how much you criticize
You are not qualified to judge
You think you know everything
That's your opinion, I really don't care

Go

I Don't Care what you think
I am my own expression
I Don't Care about your opinion
My world, I decide how flamboyant it is
I Don't Care how fancy you talk
I don't need to be preached by you
I Don't Care what you say
Think I'm a fool or a joke
I Don't Care what you do
Don't even dream of knocking me down
