The song is composed by the Danish indie rock band Dúné, full of imagination. The entire song is in the treble area. The repeated rhythm of drumming and high-sounding sound effects, with a chorus of children's voices, makes the song novel and interesting. The rebellious and funny lyrics are full of destructiveness.

该曲是丹麦年轻乐队Dune作曲，曲风属于indierock，充满想象力，整首歌都在高音区。反复节奏的鼓点和击掌声的音效，配有童声的大合唱，令歌曲新颖又有趣，让你瞬间热血沸腾！叛逆而搞怪的歌词充满破坏力和张扬。

HELL! NO!
The air is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Time is about to explode

HELL! NO!
My body is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Hurry up and get me the Bomb Squad

Life is a bomb
Installed in my head
I have yet to figure out
How to defuse it
Every day my heart is a rollercoaster
I'd rather have it explode now

WHOA~(WHOA~)
WHOA~(WHOA~)
Please light me a spark

HELL! NO!
The air is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Time is about to explode

HELL! NO!
My body is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Hurry up and get me the Bomb Squad

GUCCI PRADA
Your have to ware flashy clothes to flaunt your status
Yeah right
Look at you entertaining the crowd with your hoarse voice
Yet the bomb in your heart is about to explode

HELL! NO!
The air is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Time is about to explode

HELL! NO!
My body is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Hurry up and get me the Bomb Squad

WHOA~ (WHOA~)
WHOA~ (WHOA~)
WHOA~ (WHOA~)
WOAH~

HELL! NO!
The air is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Time is about to explode

HELL! NO!
My body is about to explode

HELL! NO!
Hurry up and get me the Bomb Squad
