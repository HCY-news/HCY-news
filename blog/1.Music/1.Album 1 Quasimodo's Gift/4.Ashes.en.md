After listening to the demo for "Ashes From Fireworks," Hua Chenyu felt that the delicate melody was quite suitable for his voice and decided to include it in this album. Xi Lou wrote the song in 2012 to comfort himself while going through a difficult time. The song was similar to the deeply personal song, "I Am What I Am," covered by Hua Chenyu during the Super Boy 2013 competition. "Ashes" was not the typical kind of song that people were used to hearing. 

When Bernard Zheng received the demo for "Ashes From Fireworks," he felt it was a fortuitous coincidence as he knew the composer, Xi Lou. Zheng felt that he and Hua Chenyu shared a common understanding of music, so in order to preserve the original feeling of the song, he asked Xi Lou to help with the arrangement. Xi not only helped complete the second arrangement of the song, but ultimately stayed throughout the entire recording process. This process included five mixing modifications and Xi also recorded the harmony. In keeping with the conceptual ideas of the album, the theme of "smoke" was used throughout the arrangement and lyrics. 

Albert Leung, a judge for the 2014 Spring Festival Gala, was deeply impressed by Hua's singing in the competition. Leung was invited and immediately agreed to write lyrics for this album. In preparation for writing, he watched many videos and read many articles about Hua. Following the official recording, Leung changed the lyrics for "Ashes" an additional three times to ensure they represented the true feeling of Hua Chenyu's inner world, and also to ensure they conformed to his high standards.

In order to achieve the desired psychedelic effect of time and space, Hua Chenyu recorded the song so many times that he became hoarse. The end result was that the song appeared to be much easier to sing than it actually was.

《烟火里的尘埃》
这首歌是曲作者西楼在个人人生低潮期为了慰藉自己创作出来的作品，并呈现了现实世界之外幻想空间迷离的美丽。
词作者林夕是极为优秀的词家，其填词与华晨宇富有感染力的演唱一起，赋予了这首歌更丰富的灵魂——也许我们只是凡俗烟火里不起眼的尘埃，看着世界热闹快乐，内心却受伤如同苍老的小孩，感慨风吹过后，一去不再回来。
这首歌听起来热闹炫美，内核却是孤独的。这不是某种情感，而是人有时候涌上来的一种情绪——与外界完全疏离，想要尽情宣泄一场的冲动，以及深深的疲倦与悲哀。

这首歌后来成为华晨宇的经典作品之一。

《Ashes From Fireworks》

Composer: Xi Lou
Lyricist: Albert Leung
Arranger: Xi Lou, Bernard Zheng

Watching the dancing ashes fall down
No one notices how free and unbounded their existence is
But the whole world loves the bustle
and cannot stand my listlessness

I shouldn't be alone, falling in a trance
Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom

Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise

Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
What is there that should be or shouldn't be?

In my heart, there lives an elderly child
If the world cannot comprehend me,
then I would confess to the shadow

Am I the only one still asking
Why tomorrow will be more dazzling?
In the fireworks, no remnants of innocence can be found

Only I am guarding the quiet desert
Waiting for flowers to bloom

Only I look at others' happiness
And would sigh to my surprise

Just let me listen to these grand philosophies
Unwilling to understand them
There's only me
Who is just me
How strange

I am still sighing
Gusts of wind are blowing past
Why doesn't it come back?
The wind leaves and never returns
Isn't it sad?
We become numb so fast
Should or shouldn't it be?
Can it slow down?

Laugh whole heartily
Cry frankly
Why should my expressions be arranged
by this world?

I am just me
I am only me

Just the falling ashes from an outburst of fireworks
Gusts of wind are blowing past
The wind leaves and never returns
Can it slow down?
