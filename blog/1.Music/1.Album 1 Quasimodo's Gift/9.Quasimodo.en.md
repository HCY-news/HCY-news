Hua Chenyu's inspiration for "Quasimodo's Gift" came after seeing an abstract painting in a church in Italy during the European tour of the reality television show Divas Hit the Road. At that time, because of the program's regulations, mobile phones had to be turned in to the producers; as a result, he had no device on which to record the melody. After returning to China, he explained that he was not able to remember the melody, but two months later while composing songs for his album, he suddenly recalled that painting and immediately recorded the music on the piano. When writing this song, the picture in Hua Chenyu's mind was of a church at night, with a lonely sufferer kneeling in front of a single candle.

"Quasimodo's Gift" is in some ways classical in style, but is still infused with popular musical elements. Bernard Zheng produced the music so that the painful feelings evoked by the demo became more beautiful and sad. He also included the sounds one would experience on a dark and rainy night, such as thunder, lightening, and church bells.  These environmental sounds immediately bring to mind a lonely singer in the dark. It took Hua Chenyu only about two hours to record this song. 


《卡西莫多的礼物》是华晨宇在参加《花儿与少年》节目欧洲游的时候，在意大利教堂里面看到一幅很抽象的画，突然来的灵感。当时因为节目规定，手机上交，没有设备可记录这一段旋律，回国后苦思不得。 而两个月后，正在给唱片创作歌曲的华晨宇，又突然回想起那幅画，立即用钢琴记录下旋律。该曲有一点偏古典风格，但是又有流行的音乐元素在里面。
华晨宇创作这首歌的时候，脑海里想象的画面是，黑夜的教堂里，一柱烛光，一个孤单的痛苦的人跪在烛光前。

《Quasimodo's Gift》
   卡西莫多的礼物

Composer :Dúné

Arrangers: Bernard Zheng,Dúné

Life is an excuse
Threatening us to give it all up
I'm stretched thin
But I get it get it

I am immortal
Although in your eyes
I am nothing but a trapped beast
I should be immortal

Only by seizing eternity can I be satisfied
I'm above being a lowly clown
Cowardice is not an excuse
To let me quit quit quit to fight
As time decays
Sorry, but I get it get it

I am immortal
A curse that takes over all rationality
Like a black hole that devours all
I should be immortal
I refuse to be forgotten by reality
I'm above being a lowly clown

I am immortal
Should be engraved into memory forever
Served without reservations
I should be immortal
Forever worshipped by all beings
I have the perfect freedom

I am immortal
Should be engraved into memory forever
Served without reservations
I should be immortal
Forever worshipped by the world

I have the perfect freedom
I'm immortal to begin with
Why should I compromise or yield
Now it's your turn to kneel down
Say you get it get it
