"Immortal" is another song originally composed by indie rock band Dúné and chosen by Hua Chenyu. Given that song selection was made from over 20,000 demos, it’s clear that Hua truly loves the music of this band, as he chose several of their songs in this first album. The fast-paced musical style of "Immortal" is metal, rhythmic, and rocky. There are distinct stylistic differences between the more electronic verses and the rock-style chorus.

Bernard Zheng’s arrangement emphasized the guitar segments with a very interesting interlude. The vocals are challenging for the singer, as they are high in the treble range with explosive segments. Hua Hua received praise from the sound engineers during the recording process as he was not only able to sing in that high range for many hours at a time, but also returned the next day rested and able to give his best.

The young and wild attitude of the song arises from the combination of melody, instrumentation and Hua’s powerful singing. The wonderful lyrics composed by Guo De Ziyi are determined, proud and unyielding; echoed by the wild cries of a princely, passionate young man.


《不朽》
这应该是华晨宇自己比较喜爱的一首作品。虽然后来他尝试过很多音乐风格，但实质上他本人应该是比较偏爱摇滚的。

通常来说，喜欢摇滚的音乐人也能很容易掌握流行抒情类的音乐，但习惯流行类音乐的歌手却很难通透摇滚音乐的精髓。华晨宇无论在哪个音乐间隙里唱一两句摇滚风，那股纯粹的摇滚味就会扑面而来。所以他骨子里是个摇滚音乐人。
这首歌属于带点电子的新金属摇滚，其中的激情、个性、自信非常凸显。这种沸腾张扬的锐气只有年轻人才有，也被华晨宇极好地在音乐中释放了出来。

《Immortal》
   不朽

Composer :Dúné
Lyricist: Guo Deziyi
Arrangers: Bernard Zheng,Dúné

Life is an excuse
Threatening us to give it all up
I'm stretched thin
But I get it get it

I am Immortal
Although in your eyes
I am nothing but a trapped beast
I should be Immortal

Only by seizing eternity can I be satisfied
I'm above being a lowly clown
Cowardice is not an excuse
To let me quit quit quit to fight
As time decays
Sorry, but I get it get it

I am Immortal
A curse that takes over all rationality
Like a black hole that devours all
I should be Immortal
I refuse to be forgotten by reality
I'm above being a lowly clown

I am Immortal
Should be engraved into memory forever
Served without reservations
I should be Immortal
Forever worshipped by all beings
I have the perfect freedom

I am Immortal
Should be engraved into memory forever
Served without reservations
I should be Immortal
Forever worshipped by the world

I have the perfect freedom
I'm Immortal to begin with
Why should I compromise or yield
Now it's your turn to kneel down
Say you get it get it
