"Traveling" is one of several songs chosen by Hua Chenyu which were composed by the Danish band, Dúné. He liked their songs so much that he actually chose four for his first album.

The vocals, sound effects, and instrumentation come together to make "Traveling" sound ethereal, transparent, and psychedelic; as though traveling in outer space. The lyrics describe a journey through life where Hua Chenyu encourages listeners to follow that journey with courage and youthful vitality. The song conveys the positive energy of youth, a new generation of rock style in comparison to the previous heavy and rather angry expression of the former generation.

The studio version incorporates a multitude of electronic sound effects, and although perhaps not as popular as "Ashes From Fireworks" or "I Don’t Care," "Traveling" is an extremely challenging song to sing with a wide range and many different transitions from one register to another.

《环游》
这首歌使用了大量的电子音效，以一种不受限制的想象的旅游之心，环游地球，行走人生旅程。
华晨宇在歌中表达出积极明亮的生命态度，鼓励听歌的歌迷勇敢生活，保持阳光般的心态，歌曲正能量十分充足。

《Traveling》

Composer: Dúné
Lyricists: Changyou Meizhihui, Liu Yuan
Arrangers: Dúné, Bernard Zheng

I stand at a crowded intersection
Listening to the crowd's endless quarrels
Arguing over pointless excuses
Arguing over going left or right

I travel around this planet
Watching how time fiddles with hourglasses
I don't want to standstill
I stride forward
Striding towards brilliance

Fly on both feet
Never tire
Soaring, a tenacious flower bud

Fly boldly
Without sorrows
What a bright world

The other shore falls in love with searching
Yet the sky falls in love with running
How dare we fall asleep
How dare we complain

This life is an endless journey
Chasing is in the future of the future
Let's see who will concede
Let's see who will halt their steps
I will stay all the way

Fly bravely
Embrace and kiss the rain
Soaring upwind makes the flight more cherished

Fly gloriously
Embrace and kiss this enchantment

An unwavering flower bud
Soaring blossoms
A blaze in the sky
Few words are uttered

This proud silence
If the march never backs off
Then dreams will not fall down
The self that flies

Fly bravely
Embrace and kiss the rain

Soaring upwind makes the flight more cherished
Fly gloriously

Embrace and kiss the enchantment
An unwavering flower bud
