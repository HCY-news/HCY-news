The song is composed by the Danish indie rock band Dúné, full of imagination. The entire song is in the treble area. The repeated rhythm of drumming and high-sounding sound effects, with a chorus of children's voices, makes the song novel and interesting. The rebellious and funny lyrics are full of destructiveness.

《环游》
这首歌使用了大量的电子音效，以一种不受限制的想象的旅游之心，环游地球，行走人生旅程。
华晨宇在歌中表达出积极明亮的生命态度，鼓励听歌的歌迷勇敢生活，保持阳光般的心态，歌曲正能量十分充足。

《Traveling》

Composer: Dúné
Lyricists: Changyou Meizhihui, Liu Yuan
Arrangers: Dúné, Bernard Zheng

I stand at a crowded intersection
Listening to the crowd's endless quarrels
Arguing over pointless excuses
Arguing over going left or right

I travel around this planet
Watching how time fiddles with hourglasses
I don't want to standstill
I stride forward
Striding towards brilliance

Fly on both feet
Never tire
Soaring, a tenacious flower bud

Fly boldly
Without sorrows
What a bright world

The other shore falls in love with searching
Yet the sky falls in love with running
How dare we fall asleep
How dare we complain

This life is an endless journey
Chasing is in the future of the future
Let's see who will concede
Let's see who will halt their steps
I will stay all the way

Fly bravely
Embrace and kiss the rain
Soaring upwind makes the flight more cherished

Fly gloriously
Embrace and kiss this enchantment

An unwavering flower bud
Soaring blossoms
A blaze in the sky
Few words are uttered

This proud silence
If the march never backs off
Then dreams will not fall down
The self that flies

Fly bravely
Embrace and kiss the rain

Soaring upwind makes the flight more cherished
Fly gloriously

Embrace and kiss the enchantment
An unwavering flower bud
