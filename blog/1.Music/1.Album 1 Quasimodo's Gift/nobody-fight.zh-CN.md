At the end of June 2014, the album "Quasimodo's Gift" was ended with the songs choosing. Hua Chenyu wrote "Why Nobody Fights" after watching a soccer game in Europe. Hua Chenyu wanted to dedicate the song to the audience to encourage the listener to be the true self.


Although the song has only one lyrics, each sentence requires different expressions. So the recording took four days. The producer of the song, Bernard Zheng, initially asked his friends to record the chorus. After rough-cutting, Hua felt it's too perfect and decided to find someone else. In order to create a mysterious and empty group voice feeling, many people are needed. Hua Chenyu recommended to invite his fans, so he selected 100 fans to participate in the recording of the big orchestra recording studio, completed the recording in two hours.

2014年6月底，专辑《卡西莫多的礼物》收歌进行收尾阶段，华晨宇在看完一场足球赛后写出了《Why Nobody Fights》，华晨宇想把该曲献给听众，鼓励听众做真实的自己。

虽然该曲歌词只有一句，但是每句细节要求不同，所以录音用了三四天的时间。该曲制作人郑楠起初让自己的朋友录了大合唱，粗剪出来后，他觉得过于完美，于是决定找其他人。而为了营造神秘和空旷的群体声音感觉，需要很多人，华晨宇便推荐了他的粉丝，从而联系他的歌迷会，选取了100名粉丝到大管弦乐录音棚参与录制，在两个小时内完成了录制。
