Toward the end of June 2014, when work on the album Quasimodo's Gift was in its final stages, Hua Chenyu wrote "Why Nobody Fights," which was inspired by a most unlikely source. In an interview, Hua stated that the inspiration for this song came after watching a soccer match during his travels in Europe. He wanted to dedicate the song to his audience to encourage them to be true to themselves.

Hua Chenyu takes great pride in the fact that he wrote the only line of lyrics in this song. He has only one other lyricist credit in his four-album repertoire. With each repetition of that line (why nobody fights), the delivery is slightly different.  As a result, recording it wasn't easy and it took several days. Bernard Zheng, now Hua's long-time producer, recruited the renowned American mixing engineer, music producer, and multi-instrumentalist, Ken Lewis for the downmixing. Zheng initially invited some friends to sing the chorus, which in a concert setting would be sung by the audience. However, after listening to the rough cut, Hua felt that it was too perfect and decided to go in a different direction. To create the mysterious "choir"-inspired feeling that he wanted, many people would need to participate. Hua then recommended inviting his fans to participate. One hundred fans gathered at a large orchestral recording studio to complete the accompaniment and achieve the dramatic choral effect he had hoped for.

2014年6月底，专辑《卡西莫多的礼物》收歌进行收尾阶段，华晨宇在看完一场足球赛后写出了《Why Nobody Fights》，华晨宇想把该曲献给听众，鼓励听众做真实的自己。该曲制作人郑楠特邀美国的混音师kenlewis来做这首歌曲的缩混。

虽然该曲歌词只有一句，但是每句细节要求不同，所以录音用了三四天的时间。该曲制作人郑楠起初让自己的朋友录了大合唱，粗剪出来后，他觉得过于完美，于是决定找其他人。而为了营造神秘和空旷的群体声音感觉，需要很多人，华晨宇便推荐了他的粉丝，从而联系他的歌迷会，选取了100名粉丝到大管弦乐录音棚参与录制，在两个小时内完成了录制。
