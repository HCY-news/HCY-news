“Glimmer,” just like its name, is a soft and gentle song performed with exceptional tenderness by Hua Chenyu. A piano accompaniment is all that’s needed as he sings this simple melody. The music is sometimes quiet, sometimes it swells. "Glimmer" is intricate and intense, but without the rock edge and technical high notes Hua is known for. This delicate arrangement highlights the beauty and power of Hua Chenyu's voice and demonstrates his careful control. Still, Hua permits the subtle emotion of the song to shine, which allows the listener to feel that glimmer of light.

《Glimmer》
   微光

Composer: Qian Lei
Lyricist: Zhou Jieying
Arranger: Bernard Zheng
 

In darkness
I turn into a tinder
For you
I want to light up the entire starry sky

Following the gentle breeze
I settled in your sweet dreams
With your smile
You hid in my heart

No need for fireworks or starlights
Just ask what is at the bottom of my heart
In this world of mine
Is there a corner
A land afar you've never known?

Perhaps I am just a Glimmer
Yet a brilliant light is what
I want to shine upon you

I would rather get hurt
In the darkness of night
Quietly for you
I shine in solitude

Just let me be a Glimmer
That gives you splendid lights
In times of loneliness
In whichever way you fly
Bloom will I
To give you an endless Glimmer

No need for fireworks or starlights
Just ask what is at the bottom of your heart
In this world of mine
Is there a corner
A land afar you've never known?

Perhaps I am just a Glimmer
Yet a brilliant light is what
I want to shine upon you

I would rather get hurt
In the darkness of night
Quietly for you
I shine in solitude

Just let me be a Glimmer
That gives you splendid lights
In times of loneliness
In whichever way you fly

Bloom will I
To give you an endless Glimmer
