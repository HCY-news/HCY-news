As soon as Hua Chenyu arrived home one day, he sat down at the piano and began to compose. "Let You Go" was the result. Beginning with the first harmony, the melody was already established, and Hua Chenyu was able to record the music as he played and sang. In his own words, it was "a song written in a song's time."

After listening to the demo, Hua’s producer Bernard Zheng agreed that the chords he used and the emphatic way he sang "let you go" in English suited the electronic rock style. The arrangement of the song has two distinct parts; the first part of the song has the feeling of restraint, which allows the listener to focus on the vocals and the simple piano accompaniment. In the second part of the song, the restraint fades and energy begins to build. The long introduction creates a feeling of suppression until the end of the interlude where, following the rhythm of the drums and the incorporation of other instruments and electronic sounds, the tones are built and layered to create a theatrical conflict. The singer’s words in Chinese and English, “let you go, 别靠近我 (stay away from me),” intensifies that contrast. During audio mixing, Ken Lewis minimized the rock elements of the song, strengthening instead the electronic components, and finally toning down the guitar.


《Let You Go》
作为这首歌的曲创作者，华晨宇自己说，是“一首歌的时间写了一首歌”，所以我们在听的时候，能够感受到音乐前半部分某种随意的流畅性，像是有个念头随随便便溜达着走。

音乐后面的强烈暗黑元素，来自华晨宇年轻灵魂的释放。为了自由，为了理想，为了真实自我，他愿意选择孤独、燃烧和陨落。这是一种很自然的年轻人叛逆精神的坦露。

这个时候的华晨宇，心态上还是相对有些迷惘的，想寻找自己的方向，却还没有完全清楚自己的所需。

《Let You Go》

Composer: Hua Chenyu 
Lyricist: Xia Yuan 
Arranger: Bernard Zheng 

Let You Go...

If there is still happiness  
Bury it in the forgotten desert  
If there is still sorrow  
Toss it down the mountain of despair  
What is left that hasn't been swept away yet  
Shadows are all that's needed  
In my isolation  
Giving me company  

Let You Go

Stay away from me  
I only live to seek the truth  

Let You Go

Nothing can manipulate
My choices

Let You Go

Don't try to stop me
My only want
Burn without care of crashing from the skies

Let You Go

Don't let my ego
Be rescued

Let You Go
