#### Lyrics:
<div class="box">
《The Return of the Master》
         高手归来

Lyricist: Zhou Jiehao
Singer: Hua Chenyu

Love is like a vast barren sea
I am seeing through the fog
as the tide hits against me
The piercing pain is so cruel

Love has no place to hide
I hold it in my hands
Wait till the master breaks out
Everything will be under control

The destiny behind my back is waiting to be unraveled
I am grappling with my fate with strategic maneuvers
Your side
I will let you set your eyes on me

Come back, every heart is hoping
Come back, the master will come back for you
You must come back
You cannot escape anymore
Love stays forever

Come back, every heart is hoping
Come back, the master will come back for you
You must come back
You cannot escape anymore
Love stays forever
