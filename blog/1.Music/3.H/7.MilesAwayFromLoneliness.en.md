2016年初，华晨宇一个人独自在国外旅行，那段时间他经常一个人走在街上，或是走在山里，心里有无限往事。写这首歌的时间是没有光的清晨，他感觉自己一人独自在隧道中一直走路，却永远走不到尽头，心里很安静，这样的感觉，好似能听见时间流淌的声音，清清的风和雾在身边，有一些孤单。歌曲DEMO原名叫《在路上》，注重自然，淡淡的感悟和温柔的歌声交织着对生命沿途风景的欣赏与怀念。

歌曲邀请了易家扬量身打造歌词，写出了温暖而带着旧日的温馨，用"路、信、风、乌云、沙漠"等具象概念贴近你的心。"逆着风，没法走，对吧？自由，可没说，可以回头"几句戳中人心的自问自答，让冬日旅途中的孤单定格。"爱在地图上剥落，我离孤单几公里？看着天对自己说，不要怕，往前走。爱已无话可说了，只想孤单想念你，关于回忆的沙漠，我没怕，也不哭，对吗？"孩子气的一段内心独白，把一个旅途中有一点失落、一点不确定、一点委婉、一点青涩、一点梦样的憧憬、还有一点自我沉醉的心境都组合起来，让你看见孤单的自己

《Miles Away From Loneliness》
      我离孤单几公里
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricists: Dai Yuedong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

A road traveled countless times
through the sunsets
A letter written with so many what-ifs
Against the wind
Hardly can one move
Right?

Freedom never says
One can turn back the clock
Love is peeling off the map
How many miles am I away from loneliness?
Gazing at the sky, I tell myself
Don't be afraid
Keep on walking
Love has no words left to be said
All I want is to think of you alone
The desert of memory
I'm not scared of it and I won't cry
Right?

Scared of walking
On the road under the clouds
For it would suddenly rain
That's right
Scared of walking
On the road in my dreams
For I would suddenly think of you again
Lost in thoughts for too long
How long have I slept on this bed feeling fragile?
How many bites of apples have I swallowed the entire day?

I exchange a cup of tea
with a blossom of loneliness
Passersby walk away under the clouds
Love weathers through the wind and the sand
Love is peeling off the map
How many miles am I away from loneliness?
Gazing at the sky, I tell myself
Don't be afraid
Keep on walking
Love has no words left to be said
All I want is to think of you alone
The desert of memory
I'm not scared it and I won't cry
Right?

Scared of walking
On the road under the clouds
For it would suddenly rain
That's right
Scared of walking
On the road in my dreams
For I would suddenly think of you again
I can't let go
That's right
Scared of walking
On the road under the clouds
For it would suddenly rain
That's right

Scared of walking
On the road in my dreams
For I would suddenly think of you again
Lost in thoughts for too long
