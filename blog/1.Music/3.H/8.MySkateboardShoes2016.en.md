在《天籁之战第一季》第三期节目中，华晨宇被素人指定改编《我的滑板鞋》。华晨宇研究了歌词，觉得非常适合改变成说唱，希望把这首歌写成诉说感很强的歌。因为歌曲本身说唱的节奏是非常个人化的节奏，所以华晨宇大部分的时间花在改编节奏上，用了很长的时间想这首歌的框架。华晨宇把歌曲原有的节奏拆了再重新拼装起来，花了很长的时间；但是录和声的时间很短，几分钟就搞定了。歌曲加入了许多自身喜欢的摇滚及Rap元素，且在24小时内改编完成

There are things that I’ve forgotten
But I still remember
that my mom asked me one night
Why are you sad today
I said in my imagination there was a pair of skateboard shoes
Unique, most fashionable, and perfect for dancing

I searched through every street in the city
Yet I could not find it
She said I would find it one day
and time will give me an answer

I went out searching on Sunday once more
Yet I still couldn’t find it

One month later I went to another city
People here call it the City of Glamour

Time flew by and the night was about to fall
I thought it was time to go
Just when I was about to leave
I passed by a specialty store
Sitting there were the skateboard shoes
that I wanted
Sitting there were the skateboard shoes
that I wanted

My skateboard shoes were the most fashionable, the most fashionable

On the way home, I couldn't help
Rubbing rubbing
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
Rub it
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
Rub it

One step two step, I rub it
Step by step like the steps of the devil
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
One step two step, I rub it

Step by step like the steps of the devil
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
I see my shadow under the moonlight
Sometimes far sometimes near
I felt a power driving my steps
With my skateboard shoes,
even the night won't scare me
With my skateboard shoes,
even the night won't scare me

This was a beautiful moment in my life
I wanted to finish my favorite dance
Under this beautiful moonlight
On this beautiful street
I told myself that it was real
It was not a dream
I told myself it was real and not a dream
Rubbing rubbing rubbing
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor, rub it
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor, rub it
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor

One step two step, I rub it
Step by step like the steps of the devil
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
One step two step, I rub it
Step by step like the steps of the devil
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
One step two step, I rub it

Step by step like the steps of the devil
Rubbing my feet on the glossy floor
I see my shadow under the moonlight
Sometimes far and sometimes near
I felt a power driving my steps
With my skateboard shoes,
even the night won't scare me
With my skateboard shoes,
even the night won't scare me

This was a beautiful moment in my life
I wanted to finish my favorite dance
Under this beautiful moonlight
On this beautiful street
I told myself that it was real and not a dream
I told myself that it was real and not a dream
