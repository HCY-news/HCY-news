《消失的昨天》是专辑里唯一的情歌。因为华晨宇觉得他阅历不够，不太擅长写情歌，于是邀请王子、姚若龙共同创作了该曲

使用了"6415"和声走向，曲作者王子在AB段做了调式区分，使得旋律既不太腻歪，但又不乏深情。演唱上，华晨宇温柔的嗓音把歌曲的伤心表现的丝丝入扣。从尾音的小颤音，到性感撕裂的副歌、细节音符的处理，层层递进地网住听者的神经。暧昧的开场道出故事的结局，多层次的和声和提琴弦乐相得益彰。副歌部分，声音的爆发拉扯情绪的悸动，像高温熔断听众的思念。华晨宇把整首歌曲演绎成一封分手后的单人告白

#### Lyrics:

《Vanishing Yesterday》
     消失的昨天

Composer: Wang Zi
Lyricists: Yao Ruolong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

In a dark room
I"m thinking about how I felt when you were here
Only by blocking the sun and the moon
Can I reminisce
All that I had with you with a deep passion
The more intimate we were
The more shattering
it was when we parted

In my world
Not just everyone can push the door
and see My childlike side
I could not understand your decision
I thought you were selfish
But in the end, I became considerate
What a pity that you never discovered
The changes I made for you
Full of touching memories

My heart was drained empty
I stretched out my hands
Yet I could not hold on to your vanishing shadow
How desolate I was!

With bowed head
I bore all the reproaches I disagreed with

All I could think of
Was how much I love you to care about
anything else

I could not understand your decision
I thought you were selfish
But in the end, I became considerate
What a pity that you never discovered

The changes I made for you
Full of yearning and longing
My mind was left blank
My hands stretched out

Blindly believing in love,
by no means could I resist

My crazy passion
Who knew that love
Could drift away and fall after being lit up
Filling the sky with bitterness
Refusing to cover up the past
I am buried in thoughts
