"Miles Away from Lonely" was created by Hua Chenyu while he was on vacation in Japan. He was walking in a tunnel and felt very lonely, so he had the inspiration to create the demo and named it "On the Road". After communicating with the lyricist, the title of the song was finally set as "Miles Away from Loneliness". 

Lyricism is the mainstay of the song. Adopting his singing style for ballad songs,  Hua Chenyu uses an euphemistic airy and soft tone in this song. The melodious vocal fits perfectly with the orchestration, creating a relaxing and natural feeling. Hua uses a tone which is a shade deeper but still clear, exemplifies a touch of sadness in the melody. Crescendo methods were used in many parts along the song, each long note has a crescendo treatment, chorus background is also designed from soft to strong and followed by a strong ending,  so that the high and low notes are not overly explosive but very heart soothing.

2016年初，华晨宇一个人独自在国外旅行，那段时间他经常一个人走在街上，或是走在山里，心里有无限往事。写这首歌的时间是没有光的清晨，他感觉自己一人独自在隧道中一直走路，却永远走不到尽头，心里很安静，这样的感觉，好似能听见时间流淌的声音，清清的风和雾在身边，有一些孤单。歌曲DEMO原名叫《在路上》，注重自然，淡淡的感悟和温柔的歌声交织着对生命沿途风景的欣赏与怀念。

歌曲邀请了易家扬量身打造歌词，写出了温暖而带着旧日的温馨，用"路、信、风、乌云、沙漠"等具象概念贴近你的心。"逆着风，没法走，对吧？自由，可没说，可以回头"几句戳中人心的自问自答，让冬日旅途中的孤单定格。"爱在地图上剥落，我离孤单几公里？看着天对自己说，不要怕，往前走。爱已无话可说了，只想孤单想念你，关于回忆的沙漠，我没怕，也不哭，对吗？"孩子气的一段内心独白，把一个旅途中有一点失落、一点不确定、一点委婉、一点青涩、一点梦样的憧憬、还有一点自我沉醉的心境都组合起来，让你看见孤单的自己

《Miles Away From Loneliness》
      我离孤单几公里
   
Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricists: Dai Yuedong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

A road traveled countless times through the sunsets
A letter written with so many what-ifs
Against the wind
Hardly can one move
Right?

Freedom never says
One can turn back the clock
Love is peeling off the map
How many miles am I away from loneliness?
Gazing at the sky, I tell myself
Don't be afraid
Keep on walking
Love has no words left to be said
All I want is to think of you alone
The desert of memory
I'm not scared of it and I won't cry
Right?

Scared of walking
On the road under the clouds
For it would suddenly rain
That's right
Scared of walking
On the road in my dreams
For I would suddenly think of you again
Lost in thoughts for too long
How long have I slept on this bed feeling fragile?
How many bites of apples have I swallowed the entire day?

I exchange a cup of tea
with a blossom of loneliness
Passersby walk away under the clouds
Love weathers through the wind and the sand
Love is peeling off the map
How many miles am I away from loneliness?
Gazing at the sky, I tell myself
Don't be afraid
Keep on walking
Love has no words left to be said
All I want is to think of you alone
The desert of memory
I'm not scared it and I won't cry
Right?

Scared of walking
On the road under the clouds
For it would suddenly rain
That's right
Scared of walking
On the road in my dreams
For I would suddenly think of you again
I can't let go
That's right
Scared of walking
On the road under the clouds
For it would suddenly rain
That's right

Scared of walking
On the road in my dreams
For I would suddenly think of you again
Lost in thoughts for too long
