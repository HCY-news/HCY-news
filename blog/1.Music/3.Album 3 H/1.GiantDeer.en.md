"Giant Deer" is the first song composed by Hua Chenyu for this album in early 2016.  The song was inspired by a peculiar dream. In the dream, Hua Chenyu ran all the way through the darkness and reached a white world. There he saw a group of white angels dancing and playing. He woke up in the middle of night and wrote this song in the dark. Hua Chenyu communicated specially with Dai Yuedong, and felt the story could be expressed well in an anthropomorphic way. Dai Yuedong finally chose the symbolic purity "Giant Deer" as the lyrics image, because "Giant Deer" itself represents "weird dream".

In order to maintain the sanctity and ethereal inspiration of the song, Zheng Nan specially recruited a string band of more than 40 members for accompaniment. The harmony in the song is all from Hua Chenyu's vocals. Hua Chenyu also deliberately adopted an abnormal harmony singing method. "Giant Deer" begins with a piano solo, and then joined with wind instruments, from quiet to crescendo and then back to quiet, the continuous changes of multiple groups of high notes and harmony create a beautiful and holy atmosphere.

《巨鹿》以钢琴独奏开篇，然后加入管乐，由安静到渐强再回归宁静，多组高音与和声的不断变化，营造了唯美的圣洁氛围。《造物者》旋律简单、跳跃，流行电音加Rap的音乐风格和上口的曲调都充满年轻节奏和生活态度，脑洞大开的歌词彰显了歌曲的主题：自由的灵魂

《Giant Deer》
     巨鹿  

Composer: Hua Chenyu
Lyricist: Dai Yuedong
Arranger: Bernard Zheng

In the universe
Have I surpassed the speed of light?
Hiding behind the Milky Way
Who would find me?
A strange dream
Canters across the night sky
Like a Giant Deer in the darkness

Run
Chasing the sunlight
Running afar
Fly

Waving both arms
Turning them into wings
I seek to cross the endless void
Unbound by reality
I yearn to leave for another nation
And dance with the shooting stars

Run
Chasing the sunlight
Running afar
Fly

Waving both arms
Turning them into wings
Turning them into wings
