- This is Hua's classic look when he first started his journey towards stardom under the public's eyes. 

- This look consists of a pair of black-rimmed glasses, bangs that covers his eyebrows, and a frequent wide grin.

- The word 橘(orange) comes from the incident where he ate quite a number of mandarin oranges while waiting for his turn during the first audition for Super Boy 2013. Hua ended up having stomach discomfort and was at the restroom when his turn came. Thus the famous scene where his contestant number "08042" was called repeatedly everywhere while looking for him.

- As for the word 呆(dorky) refers to the dorky and adorable side of Hua at that time. He used to avoid the camera as much as he could and often answered slowly in single word or short phrases during interviews. Even up until today, this adorkable Hua continues to capture many hearts with his dorky answers and adorable grin.

- The word 揪means pull

- This is because this hairstyle requires the hair to be pulled into a ponytail at the top of the head

- Jiu Jiu made his first public appearance during the filming of Flowers on Trip in 2017 when Hua's bangs was too long for his liking. So he pulled his hair into a ponytail to get them out of his face  

- However, Jiu Jiu's appearance was short-lived as it lasted only for a few episodes before it was cut in the famous pot-haircut-session in episode 6 of Flowers on Trip

- One of Jiu Jiu's famous incidents was when he accidentally dropped the watermelon that he was carrying on his way back to the hotel while attempting runway walk. Today, this "watermelon tragedy" remains as one of the funniest scenes in this travelling show

</div>

- Sa Sa is also known as立风 (li4 feng1), which is a result of separating the character  飒 into two words

- The word 飒 comes from the Chinese idiom - 英姿飒爽(ying1 zi1 sa4 shuang3) which means valiantly dashing

- In a recent HCY148 popularity poll carried out in Weibo by fellow Martians, Sa Sa won the first place with 13,000 votes, indicating an overwhelming majority of the votes

- Sa Sa was spotted in the year 2019 during Chengdu Bit & Beat Fest (BBF), Shanghai Sun Music Festival and Qingdao Phoenix Music Festival. Not only so, Sa Sa also appeared in The Coming One Season 3, mesmerizing the audience with his charming looks  

- A particular cheeky incident of Sa Sa was when he responded to Martians’ request for him to trim his hair. In the video, he took out a pair of scissors and claimed that he’ll cut his hair. And...he did!! Just ONE single strand of hair. With the wide grin before he ended the video, it was mischievous Hua Hua indeed!

- In short, dashing Sa Sa is definitely the hearthrob of many Martians!

<div class="center shadow" markdown="1">

</div>

- This nickname originates from 十辰于 (shi2 chen2 yu2), a name after removing the upper part of each Chinese character of his name 华晨宇, in correspond to his shaved head

- Here’s the breakdown of each character:
华 - 化 = 十
晨 - 日 = 辰
宇 - 宀 = 于

- The story behind this HCY148 is one where he kept his promise after failing to grab his own concert ticket for the third time

- It all began when Hua tried to prove that his concert tickets were not that difficult to get as claimed by Martians. Confidently, he joined in the ticket-snatching fray but failed twice miserably. Before the third round of ticket sales, Hua pledged to shave his head should he return empty-handed for a third time. Finally when the day came, the story took an interesting twist when Hua admitted sheepishly on Weibo that he had overslept and missed the ticket sales. On October 26, Shi Ye first made his appearance in a selfie on Weibo, proving that he is a man true to his word and wowing everyone with his new look

- Shi Ye’s first public appearance was during Tmall Double 11 Gala 2019, looking stunning in a silver windbreaker and beret

</div>

- The word 丸 (wan2) originates from the name Maruko, the main character of a well-known Japanese anime and manga series Chibi Maruko Chan
- The name was given due to the resemblance between Hua Hua’ straight bangs and Maruko's when Maruko had a disastrous haircut in Episode 936
- The word 总 (zong3) means CEO, thus the literal meaning of 丸总 is CEO Maruko as Maruko Hua exudes a boss-like aura 
- Maruko Hua was first seen in Singer 2018 Episode 8 singing "Flammable and Explosive"
- Not only so, Maruko Hua was also spotted on several occasions such as Let Go My Baby! Season 3 Episode 7 and 8 and Conde Nast Traveler magazine
- Maruko Hua is often mistaken for Rong Rong and Curly Hua as these two HCY148 do look similar in some ways such as the hair length and the slightly curled hair
- So when you're in doubt and confused, just look out for straight bangs paired with long hair, that's none other than Maruko Hua!

- 魔 (mo2) = demon
- 王 (wang2) = king
- 魔（demon）in Chinese culture is a concept coming from Buddhism. It refers to various factors that hinder the attainment of enlightenment. There are four kinds of demons: the demon of five sensory organs, the demon of worries, the demon of emotions leading to early death and the demon of trying too hard to attain enlightenment
- In the novel “Journey to The West”, the Big Demon King is Wu Kong, who is rebellious to the idea of being abstain from all emotions, desires, and sensory distractions. Consequently, he is the Big Demon King. Hua Hua is literally taking a stance by calling himself the “Big Demon King”. He is affirming these human characteristics as the basic fabric in our being just like Wu Kong
- In HCY148, Demon King also refers to the state Hua Hua is in when he’s on stage. The gaze that changes once the music starts to play. The fierce stage presence that he exudes. The full immersion in his own world when performing a song 
- The Demon King was first unleashed during Super Boy 2013 Concert Tour in Hangzhou in the year 2014 when Hua Hua took off his signature black-rimmed glasses and caught everyone off guard with this whole new side of his

</div>

- 条形码 means barcode
- This hairstyle comes with wispy bangs that covers both eyes entirely, creating a curtain-like effect, which in turn looks like the parallel lines of a barcode 
- It was said that one day when Hua was preparing for an award ceremony, he told his stylist that he did not want his eyes to be seen by others on that day. So his stylist came up with this hairstyle to fulfil his request and so Barcode Hua was officially added into HCY148

- Barcode Hua's well-known speech was during the award presentation of IQIYI Scream Night 2015: 
"Lastly, what I'd like to say to my fans is I know that you don't care how many awards I've received, or how popular I am in the (entertainment) industry. So I'd like to say to you, today my health is great and my mood is great too. So please, take good care of yourselves."

- 西兰花means broccoli, and its last Chinese character is the same as Hua Hua's "花"
- This name was given because of Hua's curly round head that resembles the head of broccoli

</div>

- 壳 (ke2) means shell or case; 哥 (ge1) means elder brother
- This name was given as it looked like an egg shell 
- The story of how Shell-head Brother came into being is quite funny. In Flowers on Trip Episode 6, Hua Hua initially went to Er-jie’s room in search of facial mask. When he saw Lin Chi-ling trimming her hair, Hua became interested and mentioned that his bangs was getting too long 
- From there, things spiralled real fast and before he knew it, Hua was sitting obediently with a clean pot on his head while Lin Chi-ling and Er-jie were cutting his hair. The outcome? Shell-head Brother made his first appearance and HCY148 officially welcomed a new member into the fold
- When Hua first saw his new haircut, he admitted that he did not expect it to be so short. However, this new hairstyle turned out to be much well-loved when he appeared in The Coming One Season 1 as it further accentuated his suave side 
- However, in 2018 just when Martians were getting used to seeing Fluffy Hua, Hua Hua suddenly announced in Weibo that he had cut his hair short again 
- And so, Shell-head Brother returned as Shell-head Brother 2.0 and took the Bird’s Nest (Beijing National Stadium) by storm with his Mars Concert for two consecutive days
- After that, Shell-head Brother could also be seen in several other occasions such as The Coming One Season 2 and Zhuhai Shark Music Festival

- Along with Curly Hua, Whiskers Hua is grouped as fairy-like HCYs as his ethereal beauty awed those who saw him 
- Whiskers Hua is well-known for his gentleness and childlike charms

- The most memorable music festivals of Whiskers Hua are B.I.G Carnival and Strawberry Music Festival in 2017 
- Therefore unsurprisingly, a recent HCY148 poll has shown that Fairy-like Whiskers Hua is listed as one of the most popular and very much missed HCY148
