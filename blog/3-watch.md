# Watch - 手錶
## 2020-03-09

It’s been a while since I touched this blog. Let’s put some new things!

This watch is built using [Tinyscreen+](https://tinycircuits.com/products/tinyscreenplus). It has a screen, some buttons, and a processor. Additionally, I soldered a mini speaker and an external micro USB port so it can make sounds, and I can program it. I designed the case in Autodesk Inventor and was 3D printed. The band I got from another old watch, which has a pretty nice mechanics that allows it to be attached onto the case without using any screws.

For the software functionalities, there’s time display, date dieplay, school time table, stop watch, date in Chinese lunar calendar (therefore one can tell the phase of moon from it), old Chinese time.

好久沒放東西了，來把最近做的一些東西PO一下吧！

這個手錶是用[Tinyscreen+](https://tinycircuits.com/products/tinyscreenplus)做的，我另外還加了小喇叭跟外接USB頭。外殼是用Autodesk Inventor 3D列印做出來的，可以不用螺絲就固定在錶帶上，錶帶我從另一種手錶拆下來用。

程式部份有時間、日期、課表、計時器、農曆日期、時辰。
