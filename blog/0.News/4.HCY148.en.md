- This is Hua's classic look when he first started his journey towards stardom under the public's eyes. 

- This look consists of a pair of black-rimmed glasses, bangs that covers his eyebrows, and a frequent wide grin.

- The word 橘(orange) comes from the incident where he ate quite a number of mandarin oranges while waiting for his turn during the first audition for Super Boy 2013. Hua ended up having stomach discomfort and was at the restroom when his turn came. Thus the famous scene where his contestant number "08042" was called repeatedly everywhere while looking for him.

- As for the word 呆(dorky) refers to the dorky and adorable side of Hua at that time. He used to avoid the camera as much as he could and often answered slowly in single word or short phrases during interviews. Even up until today, this adorkable Hua continues to capture many hearts with his dorky answers and adorable grin.

- The word 揪means pull

- This is because this hairstyle requires the hair to be pulled into a ponytail at the top of the head

- Jiu Jiu made his first public appearance during the filming of Flowers on Trip in 2017 when Hua's bangs was too long for his liking. So he pulled his hair into a ponytail to get them out of his face  

- However, Jiu Jiu's appearance was short-lived as it lasted only for a few episodes before it was cut in the famous pot-haircut-session in episode 6 of Flowers on Trip

- One of Jiu Jiu's famous incidents was when he accidentally dropped the watermelon that he was carrying on his way back to the hotel while attempting runway walk. Today, this "watermelon tragedy" remains as one of the funniest scenes in this travelling show

- Sa Sa is also known as立风 (li4 feng1), which is a result of separating the character  飒 into two words

- The word 飒 comes from the Chinese idiom - 英姿飒爽(ying1 zi1 sa4 shuang3) which means valiantly dashing

- In a recent HCY148 popularity poll carried out in Weibo by fellow Martians, Sa Sa won the first place with 13,000 votes, indicating an overwhelming majority of the votes

- Sa Sa was spotted in the year 2019 during Chengdu Bit & Beat Fest (BBF), Shanghai Sun Music Festival and Qingdao Phoenix Music Festival. Not only so, Sa Sa also appeared in The Coming One Season 3, mesmerizing the audience with his charming looks  

- A particular cheeky incident of Sa Sa was when he responded to Martians’ request for him to trim his hair. In the video, he took out a pair of scissors and claimed that he’ll cut his hair. And...he did!! Just ONE single strand of hair. With the wide grin before he ended the video, it was mischievous Hua Hua indeed!

- In short, dashing Sa Sa is definitely the hearthrob of many Martians!

- This nickname originates from 十辰于 (shi2 chen2 yu2), a name after removing the upper part of each Chinese character of his name 华晨宇, in correspond to his shaved head

- Here’s the breakdown of each character:
华 - 化 = 十
晨 - 日 = 辰
宇 - 宀 = 于

- The story behind this HCY148 is one where he kept his promise after failing to grab his own concert ticket for the third time

- It all began when Hua tried to prove that his concert tickets were not that difficult to get as claimed by Martians. Confidently, he joined in the ticket-snatching fray but failed twice miserably. Before the third round of ticket sales, Hua pledged to shave his head should he return empty-handed for a third time. Finally when the day came, the story took an interesting twist when Hua admitted sheepishly on Weibo that he had overslept and missed the ticket sales. On October 26, Shi Ye first made his appearance in a selfie on Weibo, proving that he is a man true to his word and wowing everyone with his new look

- Shi Ye’s first public appearance was during Tmall Double 11 Gala 2019, looking stunning in a silver windbreaker and beret

- Shi Ye is also the one who held the Mars Concert 2019 in Haikou, taking everyone’s breath away with his manly presence

- Today, on the 24th of July 2020, Hua surprised everyone when he revealed that Shi Ye is back in town again

- Well, nothing is more appealing than a man who honors his words and this man is definitely Shi Ye
