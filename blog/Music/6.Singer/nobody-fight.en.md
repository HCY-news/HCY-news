At the end of June 2014, the album "Quasimodo's Gift" was ended with the songs choosing. Hua Chenyu wrote "Why nobody fights" after watching a soccer game in Europe. Hua Chenyu wanted to dedicate the song to the audience to encourage the listener to be the true self.

 

Although the song has only one lyrics, each sentence requires different expressions. So the recording took four days. The producer of the song, Bernard Zheng, initially asked his friends to record the chorus. After rough-cutting, Hua felt it's too perfect and decided to find someone else. In order to create a mysterious and empty group voice feeling, many people are needed. Hua Chenyu recommended to invite his fans, so he selected 100 fans to participate in the recording of the big orchestra recording studio, completed the recording in two hours.
