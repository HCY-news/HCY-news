# 4 bit Binary Multiplier - 4位元2進位乘法器
## 2020-03-09

A while ago, when I was learning how to build circuit boards, I wanted to play with logic gates. So I made a 4 bit binary multiplier using only logic gates. It’s also a good project to learn how computers work at the lowest level. The AND gates were made with diodes; OR gates were made with NPN transistors; XOR gates were a bit more complicated, so I used the IC CD4070 to save space. Since I need to drill lots of hole on the board,  might as well to use the CNC machine to drill them and carve the paths. After a few tries, I finished it by first put spray paint on the serface of the board, then let the machine to scribe out the circuits and drill holes, then finally, use chemicals to etch away the exposed copper.

前一陣子在學怎麼做電路板時就想玩玩邏輯門，所以就做了個4位元乘法器。用了整流子當AND，NPN電晶體當OR，XOR有點複雜所以直接用了CD4070。因為版子上的洞很多，所以想說乾脆用CNC車床來刻。試了幾種刻法後，最後是先在版子上噴漆，然後讓機器打洞跟刻出電路，最後再用化學藥劑把露出的銅吃掉。
